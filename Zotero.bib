	abstract = {Tungsten inert gas (TIG) technique was conducted on commercially pure (CP)-Ti substrate, which was coated with h-BN-based powder mixture prior to the treatment. The treated surfaces were evaluated and characterized by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction analysis, and electron dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The microhardness and wear experiment were also performed by using a microhardness machine and pin-on-disk tribometer. As h-BN reacted with titanium, an in-situ hybrid composite layer was formed showing near stoichiometric dendrites of TiN, platelets of TiB and interdendritic regions of α′-Ti martensite crystal structures. The population level of TiN and TiB regions were found to increase using a pre-placed powder mixture with greater h-BN content. However, the fabricated layers exhibited cracking and porosity; these were minimized by adjusting arc energy density and h-BN content of powder mixture. The microhardness value of the fabricated hybrid composite layers was found to be in the range of ∼650 HV0.2–1000 HV0.2; this is three to five times higher than that of the untreated CP-Ti substrate. In addition, the in-situ hybrid composite layers exhibited superior wear behavior over CP-Ti substrate; this is attributed to the formation of newly formed ceramic phases in the solidified surface layers and good coherent interface between the composite layer and CP-substrate. Meanwhile, severe adhesive wear mechanism of CP-titanium surface changed to mild abrasive one as a result of surface treatment.},

Coatings processed with mixtures of Ni and Al powders, Al content within the range 15–50 wt-\%, were analysed. In situ development of Ni aluminides was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Increasing aluminium (Al) content in the deposited mixture increased the penetration depth. The microstructure of coatings depended on the amount of Al in the deposited powder mixture associated with the exothermal synthesis of the β-NiAl intermetallic compound. The present study presents an important step towards the protection of components for equipment of higher efficiency processes, as results validated the potential of PTA hardfacing as a processing technique for surface tailoring.},

	abstract = {Heat-treatment processes to obtain carbide-free upper bainite, low bainite and low-temperature bainite in the 34MnSiCrAlNiMo medium-carbon steel were explored. Results show that in the steel bainite transformation mainly goes through three stages: short incubation, explosive nucleation and slow growth. When transformation temperature, T \&gt; Ms + 75 °C, upper bainite consisted of catenary bainitic ferrite and blocky retained austenite is obtained in the steel. When Ms + 10 °C \&lt; T \&lt; Ms + 75 °C, lower bainite is the main morphology composed of lath-like bainitic ferrite and flake-like retained austenite. When T \&lt; Ms + 10 °C, the lower bainite, also known as low-temperature bainite, is obtained, which contains much thinner lath-like bainitic ferrite and film-like retained austenite. Mechanical testing results show that the lower the transformation temperature is, the better comprehensive performance is. The low-temperature bainite has the very high tensile strength and impact toughness simultaneously. The lower bainite has lower tensile strength and higher impact toughness. The upper bainite has higher tensile strength and lower impact toughness. The big difference of the mechanical performance between these kinds of bainite is mainly caused by interface morphology, size, and phase interface structure of the bainitic ferrite and the retained austenite. Additionally, when the bainite transformation temperature is decreased, the high-angle misorientation fraction in packets of bainite ferrite plates is increased. High-angle misorientation between phase interfaces can prevent crack propagation, and thus improves impact toughness.},

The results indicate that chromium induced the formation of the acicular bainitic structure while cobalt favored massive ferrite formation and resulted in islands of martensite and/or austenite. Nickel, when added singly, did not appear to influence the microstructure but in combination with chromium, enhanced the formation of the lower bainitic structure. The mechanical properties were statistically analyzed and statistical equations were obtained to predict optimized compositions. These equations indicate that chromium increased the toughness of these steels more than nickel. However, it was shown that with similar bainitic structures, nickel enhanced the toughness more than chromium. The results illustrate the short-coming of a pure statistical approach to the design of alloys.},

Nickel additions were beneficial to strength but detrimental to impact toughness. Significant segregation of nickel and manganese to interdendritic regions was observed at the two higher nickel contents. In these weld metals a mainly martensitic microstructure developed at interdendritic regions, whereas bainite was found at dendrite core regions. The microstructural inhomogeneity was due to segregation and the accompanying stabilisation of austenite in solute enriched regions to lower transformation temperatures. With 3 wt-\% nickel the microstructure was found to be more homogeneous, with mainly bainite forming. The decrease in impact toughness with increasing nickel content was mainly attributed to the formation of coarse grained coalesced bainite.},

	abstract = {The correlation between mechanical properties and boron content in the coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) of low-alloy steel was investigated using 10 ppm and 30 ppm boron added low-alloy steels. A Gleeble system was used to simulate various CGHAZs as a function of heat input. The segregation behavior of boron in the CGHAZ was estimated through secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and particle tracking autoradiography (PTA). Vickers hardness and Charpy impact tests were performed in order to assess the mechanical properties of the CGHAZs. In the steel containing 30 ppm of boron, boron segregation was relatively high even with low heat input, and increased compared to 10 ppm boron added steel. Furthermore, the boron segregation level maintained a maximum at intermediate heat input conditions from 60 to 500 kJ/cm. This is believed that the boron segregation can be reached a maximum level for relatively low heat input despite the faster cooling rate because of an increase in the boron segregation rate. Also, impact toughness decreased with increased boron content at identical heat input conditions. It is believed that the effect of segregation and precipitation of boron on deterioration of impact toughness is insignificant. However, deterioration of impact toughness may be due to the remarkable increase in the fraction of a second phase, such as the martesite–austenite (M–A) constituent, and the hardening of the matrix with increased boron content.},

The amount of V8C7 decreases gradually from the top surface of the composite to the matrix mainly composed of gray cast iron.

The microhardness of the composite region is four times higher than that of the iron matrix and two times higher than that of the vanadium plate. This is attributed to the formation of vanadium carbide (V2C and V8C7) crystallites as reinforcement phases within the iron matrix.

(ii) Gradient distributions of TiB2 reinforcements appeared in the composite coating from both the vertical and horizontal direction of the coating's cross-section.

The majority of the studies focus on the Fe–TiB2 and/or the Fe–TiB2–TiFe2 region of the ternary Fe–Ti–B diagram, whereas the Fe–TiB2–Fe2B area has not yet been systematically studied, although it combines two very hard particles, namely TiB2 and Fe2B. This research deals with the wear behavior and tribological evaluation of Fe2B–TiB2 MMC layers, which were successfully produced on the surface of plain carbon steel, using the plasma transferred arc (PTA) technique. The counterbody, either tool steel or alumina ball, plays an important role in the wear rate and friction coefficient of the boronized surfaces. The “free” boron content in the Fe–TiB2–B system, i.e. boron not bound in TiB2, affects the tribological behavior of the alloyed layers. With steel as the counter-body material, “free” boron content increases the wear rate due to the formation of a more brittle matrix which is easily removed by adhesion, while with the alumina counter-body it has the tendency to decrease the wear rate, as the strengthened matrix can resist better to abrasion. The friction coefficient values for the tool steel ball are smaller than those of the alumina ball, owing to the different wear mechanisms involved.},

	abstract = {The synthesis of Fe–TiC metal matrix composite during metal deposition with laser and arc welding techniques is of technical and economic interest for hard surfacing of engineering components. Recent studies linked the resistance to abrasive wear with the size and morphology of TiC precipitates, which are strongly dependent on the deposition conditions and, more importantly, on the alloy chemistry. In this study, the effect of silicon and manganese on the TiC precipitates was explored and different processing conditions were assessed. The characterisation included optical and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and microhardness testing. The results indicate that silicon and manganese can have a significant effect on TiC size and morphology. Therefore, the composition of the matrix alloy offers an effective pathway to modify the microstructure of in-situ precipitated Fe–TiC metal matrix composites.},

	abstract = {Boriding of the surface of a tool steel using boron powder and the plasma transferred arc process was investigated. It was shown that this method is an easy and effective technique in producing uniform alloyed layers with a thickness of about 1.5 mm and a hardness between 1000 and 1300 HV.

The microstructure of the borided surfaces consists of primary Fe2B-type borides and a eutectic mixture of borides and martensite. Some cracks are observed in the eutectic regions but they do not seem to critically affect the behaviour of the coatings in sliding wear.

The wear rate of pin on disc tests is primarily affected by the applied load and it lies between 10−5 mm3/m for low loads and 10−2 mm3/m for high loads. Two distinct regimes of mild and severe wear are obtained separated by a critical load. Mild wear is due to the load supporting effect of borides and severe wear is due to their breakage above a critical load. The wear rate is not significantly affected by the sliding velocity and is consistent with the friction coefficient.

The friction coefficient varies from 0.13 to 0.23 and depends strongly on the oxidation status of the wear track. The sliding velocity affects the sliding distance where the coefficient of friction reaches equilibrium.},

Little effort has been directed to investigating the corrosion behaviour of these coatings. The methods used in surface modification are either metallic alloying or the deposition of a composite layer. The metallic-alloying process has gained wider acceptance than the latter technique.

Microstructural development during the solidification of each deposit is discussed. It is shown that Armacor M coating exhibits better wear performance than Armacor C coating for all wear testing investigated due to higher hardness and larger boride particles of Armacor M. The sliding wear resistance of both coatings follows a similar trend with the abrasive wear resistance. The wear rate of the pins for the pin-on-disk dry sliding wear testing is increased as the hardness of the counterpart disk is increased. It is also shown that wear rate and friction coefficient are the function of the applied stress.

Due to solidification beginning at the interface and the effect of dilution, the TiC in the interfacial layer was finer. Owing to faster solidification under low-current conditions, the TiC particles were finer than under high-current conditions. Also, dendritic TiC under a low-current in the upper overlayer was also finer than under a high-current.

	abstract = {FeCrBSi alloy powders without and with 2-6wt.\% Mo (Mo-free and Mo-added, respectively) were deposited on a plain steel using plasma transferred arc (PTA) hardfacing. The effects of Mo addition on the microstructure and properties of the FeCrBSi alloy coating were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) attachment, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Vickers hardness tester, hydraulic universal testing machine, dry sand abrasion test (DSAT) and water quenching method. The results show that the Mo-free coating consists of γ (Fe, Ni), M7(C, B)3, and (Fe, Cr)2B phases. Adding Mo leads to the formation of M23(C, B)6, Mo2(B, C) and Fe3Mo3(C, B) phases, except for those phases existed in the Mo-free coating. The twinning with 101- twinning plane is observed in the orthorhombic M7(C, B)3 (M=Fe, Cr, Mo) phase. A hypoeutectic microstructure can be seen in the Mo-free and 2wt.\% Mo-added coatings. Increasing Mo addition to 4wt.\% and 6wt.\%, a hypereutectic microstructure can be obtained. The microstructure of the Mo-free coating can be refined after adding 2-6wt.\% Mo. The finest microstructure can be obtained in the 4wt.\% Mo-added coating. Adding Mo in the FeCrBSi alloy coating can increase its abrasive wear resistance that has no direct relation with H/E or H3/E2 because brittle fracture occurred occasionally in the abrasive wear test. The thermal shock resistance of the Mo-free coating can be improved after adding 2-6wt.\% Mo. The best abrasive wear resistance and thermal shock resistance can be received in the 4wt.\% Mo-added coating. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The microstructure of the coatings is mainly γ-Fe,Ni eutectic matrix, and hexagonal M(=Cr, Fe)7(C,B)3 and M(=Cr, Fe)23(C,B)6 carbides are non-uniformly distributed in the eutectic matrix. The average microhardness of the cladding coating is 820HV, which is almost five times of that of the AISI 316 stainless steel substrate (180HV). The maximum microhardness value of the coating is about 1,280HV. Higher current levels have resulted in higher dilution levels and also in melting/burning of the substrate.},

	abstract = {Research on learning has primarily focused on the role of doing (experience) in fostering progress over time. In this paper, we propose that one of the critical components of learning is reflection, or the intentional attempt to synthesize, abstract, and articulate the key lessons taught by experience. Drawing on dual-process theory, we focus on the reflective dimension of the learning process and propose that learning can be augmented by deliberately focusing on thinking about what one has been doing. We test the resulting dual-process learning model experimentally, using a mixed-method design that combines two laboratory experiments with a field experiment conducted in a large business process outsourcing company in India. We find a performance differential when comparing learning-by-doing alone to learning-by-doing coupled with reflection. Further, we hypothesize and find that the effect of reflection on learning is mediated by greater perceived self-efficacy. Together, our results shed light on the role of reflection as a powerful mechanism behind learning.},

It was found that the nanosheets were obtained with thickness of only about 10 nm, through the exfoliation from the sulfurized outer layers of tungsten trioxide. The ball milling played a crucial role in the mechanical activation of reagents and promoted direct production of WS2 without any intermediate products.

The test results in this paper indicate that the tensile strength, elongation at break, and impact strength decreased, however, the ball indentation hardness and thermal diffusivity were increased when the content of h-BN was increased. PTFE composites filled with 20 wt\% PHBA and 20 wt\% h-BN exhibited a comparative friction coefficient to pure PTFE. Meantime, the wear rate of the composite decreased about 15 times compared to pure PTFE.

Based on the experiment results it is found that Fe–B4C composite coatings can only be prepared by PTA powder surfacing in the case that the employed surfacing current is little enough. The metallurgical reactions between Fe and B4C are limited in a very narrow region at their contacting interface in this case. With the increasing of employed surfacing current more and more B4C particles will be fully melted and reacted with the liquid iron-based alloys. However, the products of the metallurgical reactions between them are various for the different powder compositions and surfacing conditions. Most of the B4C particles will be fully melted during the PTA powder surfacing while 200 A or greater surfacing current is used. Furthermore, most of the C element in B4C particles is tending to be graphite rather than reacting with Fe to be carbides during the processing under the Fe–B4C composite powder PTA surfacing conditions.},

	abstract = {When a steel ball undergoes dry sliding against a boron carbide-coated steel coupon, both the steel ball and the boron carbide are polished, even though the boron carbide is several times harder than the steel. We have measured the abrasion rate of the steel under loads ranging from 5 to 1100 g. The average abrasion rate at and above 100 g of load shows a simple power law dependence on the number of cycles, but a deviation from this simple dependence is observed at lower loads. The loss of abrasiveness of the boron carbide correlates with a reduction of the RMS angle on the boron carbide surface, which eventually becomes nearly atomically smooth over regions as large as 1 μm×1 μm. Our results suggest that under the right conditions, a boron carbide coating could be designed to polish a counterpart gear or bearing surface with little risk that the counterpart would be substantially worn and with little concern for how the load varied during a break-in period. We suggest that polishing of the boron carbide surface by steel is a chemical process, while the abrasion of the steel by boron carbide is a mechanical process.},

Moreover, it was suggested that the Ti element, which is the active ingredient in Ag–Cu–Ti braze, reacted with N in h-BN to generate Ti–N composite phase as an interfacial precipitation and the generation of Ti–N composite phase was affected by the concentration of Ti in Ag–Cu–Ti braze.

	abstract = {The prefrontal cortex (PFC) of adult rodents is capable of undergoing neuronal remodeling and neuroimaging studies in humans have revealed that the structure of this region also appears affected in different psychiatric disorders. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying this plasticity are still unclear. The polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) may mediate these structural changes through its anti-adhesive properties. PSA-NCAM participates in neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis and changes in its expression occur parallel to neuronal remodeling in certain regions of the adult brain. PSA-NCAM is expressed in the hippocampus and temporal cortex of adult humans, but it has not been studied in the PFC. Employing immunohistochemistry on sections from the rostromedial superior frontal gyrus we have found that PSA-NCAM is expressed in the human PFC neuropil following a laminated pattern and in a subpopulation of mature neurons, which lack doublecortin expression. Most of these cells have been identified as interneurons expressing calbindin. The expression of PSA-NCAM in the human PFC is similar to that of rodents. Since this molecule has been linked to the neuronal remodeling found in experimental models of depression, it may also participate in the structural plasticity described in the PFC of depressed patients.},

An experimental campaign has been carried out on the deposition of two nickel- and a cobalt-base superalloys: Hastelloy 276, Inconel 625 and Stellite 6. Benchmarks of C-Mn steel have been chosen to test geometrical configurations that are critical for the application (corners and grooves). Specimen characterisation through liquid penetration inspection, optical- and scanning electron microscopy and microhardness tests proved that process parameters optimisation depends only on the geometrical configuration and not on the deposited alloy. This result suggests the importance of an accurate design of the reciprocal positioning and movement between the torch and the part to be coated, as a function of the deposition geometry.},

	abstract = {Plasma jets produced by direct-current (DC) non-transferred arc plasma torches, at the core of technologies ranging from spray coating to pyrolysis, present intricate dynamics due to the coupled interaction of fluid flow, thermal, and electromagnetic phenomena. The flow dynamics from an arc discharge plasma jet are investigated using time-dependent three-dimensional simulations encompassing the dynamics of the arc inside the torch, the evolution of the jet through the discharge environment, and the subsequent impingement of the jet over a flat substrate. The plasma is described by a chemical equilibrium and thermodynamic nonequilibrium (two-temperature) model. The numerical formulation of the physical model is based on a monolithic and fully-coupled treatment of the fluid and electromagnetic equations using a Variational Multiscale Finite Element Method. Simulation results uncover distinct aspects of the flow dynamics, including the jet forcing due to the movement of the electric arc, the prevalence of deviations between heavy-species and electron temperatures in the plasma fringes, the development of shear flow instabilities around the jet, the occurrence of localized regions with high electric fields far from the arc, and the formation and evolution of coherent flow structures.},

	abstract = {Two Fe–Cr–B based gas atomized powders, proposed as metamorphic alloys (Armacor M and Armacor 16), were thermally sprayed using the HVOF (High Velocity Oxygen Fuel) process. Armacor M was also weld-surfaced by PTA (Plasma Transferred Arc) process. The resultant deposits were subsequently characterized, using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and microhardness measurement. The wear performances of the different coatings were investigated by two-body abrasive and pin-on-disc dry sliding wear tests. The results from microstructural analysis of as-sprayed deposits reveal oxide and boride phases such as Fe3O4 and Cr1.65Fe0.35B0.96 in α matrix for HVOF-sprayed Armacor 16 coating, and only the boride phases (Cr1.65Fe0.35B0.96 and Cr2B) in α matrix for HVOF-sprayed Armacor M coating. PTA weld-surfaced Armacor M coating contains needle-type long precipitates of large Cr2B and Cr1.65Fe0.35B0.96 in α matrix. Wear test results show that HVOF-sprayed Armacor 16 coating exhibits the lowest wear resistance. While HVOF-sprayed and PTA weld-surfaced Armacor M coatings have the same hardness, the latter shows better abrasive and sliding wear resistance because of the size and orientation of its boride phases. More broadening in XRD patterns and hardness increase after wear testing suggest that the transformation from crystalline to amorphous structure has occurred on the uppermost layer during the wear testing. However, the wear resistance of the metamorphic alloy coatings depends more on the density and microstructure of the coatings rather than on the formation of amorphous surface structure.},

	abstract = {In the current investigation, nickel-base hardfacing alloy AWS NiCr-B was deposited on austenitic stainless steel substrate 316 LN using the plasma transferred arc-welding process. The deposit was characterized by hardness measurements, microstructural examination and sliding wear assessment. Identification of precipitates was carried out using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM/EDAX), electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA) mappings and line-scan profiles. The microstructure of the hardfacing deposit predominantly consists of the γ-Ni phase and the interdendritic eutectic mixture comprised of γ-nickel and nickel-rich borides. These studies also revealed the presence of chromium-rich carbides and borides in a γ-nickel matrix. The sliding wear behaviour of the hardfacing alloy was investigated in air at three different temperatures viz., room temperature, 300 and 500 °C. The study revealed significant weight loss at room temperature and abrupt decrease at high temperatures. This behaviour at high temperatures has been attributed to the formation of a wear protective oxide layer at the surface during sliding. To evaluate the microstructural stability of the deposit, ageing studies were carried out at 650 °C for 250 h. Microstructural examination and hardness testing revealed that there is no deterioration in the microstructure and that the hardness remains intact. Sliding wear tests at room temperature and at high temperatures also demonstrated that there is no significant change in the weight loss or the wear behaviour after the thermal exposure.},

The rate of densification increased rapidly in the range 1870°–2010°C, which was attributed to direct B4C–B4C contact between particles permitted via volatilization of B2O3 particle coatings. Limited particle coarsening, attributed to the presence or evolution of the oxide coatings, occurred in the range 1870°–1950°C. In the temperature range 2010°–2140°C, densification continued at a slower rate while particles simultaneously coarsened by evaporation–condensation of B4C. Above 2140°C, rapid densification ensued, which was interpreted to be the result of the formation of a eutectic grain boundary liquid, or activated sintering facilitated by nonstoichiometric volatilization of B4C, leaving carbon behind. Rapid heating through temperature ranges in which coarsening occurred fostered increased densities. Carbon doping (3 wt\%) in the form of phenolic resin resulted in more dense sintered compacts. Carbon reacted with B2O3 to form B4C and CO gas, thereby extracting the B2O3 coatings, permitting sintering to start at ∼1350°C.},

The overall reaction kinetics is paralinear. Linear oxidation kinetics established soon after the initiation of oxidation under the test conditions described in this report.

The hardness of the conventional form is inferior only to diamond, but when prepared with a nanostructure dominated by fine twin domains of average thickness {\textasciitilde}3.8 nm its hardness exceeds that of synthetic diamond.[1] Its thermal and chemical stability is superior to diamond.

	title = {Chemical {Principles} of the {Sulfidation} {Reaction} of {Tungsten}  {Oxides}},
	abstract = {Hydrotreating is concerned with the removal of sulfur (HDS) and nitrogen (HDN) 
from crude oil. The most common catalyst for these processes is MoS2 supported on 
γ-Al2O3 in combination with nickel or cobalt as promoters. Though used less frequently 
WS2 is also applied in hydrotreating catalysis because of its good hydrogenation 
properties. These properties are important in deep HDS and HDN, where a high 
hydrogenation activity is required. 
 Tungsten-based catalysts are prepared in the form of oxidic catalyst precursors by 
impregnating a high-surface area support, such as γ-Al2O3, with an aqueous solution of 
ammonium metatungstate or paratungstate followed by calcination in air between 500 
and 550°C. During calcination an amorphous WO3-type precursor phase forms, which is 
activated by sulfidation in H2S/H2 at temperatures between 350 and 400°C and high 
pressures to form the WS2 phase. 
 The knowledge of how the sulfidation reaction proceeds mechanistically is 
fragmentary because of the amorphous nature of the catalyst precursor. In order to find 
a mechanistic description in terms of basic surface and bulk reactions, we use the 
following chemical modelling approach: 
 
(1) The crystalline tungsten oxides m-WO3 and WO3·H2O are used as solid-state 
models of the amorphous WO3 phase. In this way basic steps of the sulfidation 
reactions of m-WO3 and WO3·H2O can be resolved and explained in terms of the 
structures of the oxides. 
(2) The WOS2 and WS3 phases, which are obtained by thermal decomposition of the 
complexes (NH4)2WO2S2 and (NH4)2WS4, are used as models of intermediates 
that may be encountered in the sulfidation reaction. Whereas WOS2 serves as a 
model of oxysulfide intermediates, we use WS3 as a model of intermediates with a 
higher S:W stoichiometry than the final product WS2. 
(3) A WO3/Al2O3 precursor is used to model industrial catalysts. 
 
The techniques used are temperature-programmed sulfidation (TPS), 
thermogravimetrical analysis and single differential thermal analysis (TGA-SDTA), 
X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared transmission (IR) and emission spectroscopy (IRES), 
Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS), X-ray photoelectron 
  XII
spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), 
as well as chemical extrusion experiments. 
 We could show that WOS2 contains W-O-W and W-S-W structures and reduced 
tungsten centres. The most important characteristic, however, is the presence of W=Ot 
entities and S2
2- ligands. 
 Amorphous WS3 was prepared by four different methods. These are the thermal 
decomposition of (NH4)2WS4, acidification of an aqueous (NH4)2WS4 solution, reaction 
of WCl6 with hexamethyldisilathiane and the reaction of (NH4)2WS4 with I2, which is 
presented here for the first time. Amorphous WS3 is a mixed valence WIV-WVI 
compound, contains S2
2- ligands and is built up by interconnected triangular \{W3S4\} 
building blocks. 
 The sulfidation reaction of m-WO3 starts at low temperatures with a reduction of 
tungsten centres due to reaction with H2S to form the tungsten bronze H0.23WO3. Only 
after this reduction does an exchange of terminal O2- ligands of the oxides for S2- take 
place. At higher temperatures oxygen-sulfur exchange processes on the surface proceed 
at a higher rate and W-S redox reactions start to occur to form S2
2- ligands. At the same 
time the H0.23WO3 hydrogen tungsten bronze transforms into the shear oxide W20O58. 
Because sulfur is present on the surface while the bulk is that of W20O58, this 
intermediate is referred to as a shear oxysulfide. Further oxygen-sulfur exchange and 
W-S redox reactions lead to oxysulfidic intermediates with structural features similar to 
that of the WOS2 model oxysulfide. The decomposition experiments with (NH4)2WS4 
and our structural characterization of WS3 show that the sulfidation of m-WO3 does not 
proceed via WS3-type intermediates. W-S redox reactions eventually transform the 
oxysulfidic sulfidation intermediate into WS2. 
 The sulfidation reaction of WO3·H2O proceeds analogously and the first step consists 
in the formation of the bronze HxWO3·H2O, followed by the incorporation of sulfur. At 
higher temperatures the structure collapses under the release of water to form HyWO3, 
which transforms into the shear oxide W25O73. Because of sulfur-oxygen exchange and 
W-S redox reactions this shear oxysulfide transforms into an oxysulfide intermediate. 
The final step is the reaction of this oxysulfide to form WS2 without the formation of a 
WS3-type of intermediate. 
 The general sulfidation sequence of both crystalline oxides is oxide → bronze → 
shear oxysulfide → oxysulfide → sulfide. This sequence provides the chemical basis for 
  XIII
understanding the sulfidation reaction of WO3/Al2O3 into WS2/Al2O3. This reaction is 
more complicated than that of both crystalline oxides. The first step is the formation of 
an HxWO3/Al2O3 bronze, which however, is not stable. Oxygen-sulfur exchange 
processes therefore already occur at room temperature. The formation of a shear 
oxysulfide is not likely because of the instability of the bronze. W-S redox processes 
lead to a phase, with structural features very similar to that of WOS2, which transforms 
into WS2. The formation of a WS3-type intermediate, however, could not be excluded.},

The microstructure and wear properties of a WC particle reinforced composite coating produced by the plasma transferred arc (PTA) method on Ti6Al4V alloy were investigated in this study. PTA processing was carried out using argon as the plasma gas at arc current values of 70 A, 80 A and 90 A. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the microstructure of the composite layer formed on the surface of a Ti6Al4V substrate. The results indicate that the WC, TiC and W2C carbide phases formed in the composite layers produced by PTA on the surface of the Ti6Al4V alloy. The distributions and volume fractions of these phases were found to vary with the arc current values. Wear tests were performed under dry sliding conditions using a linear ball-on-disc geometry. The microhardness and wear resistances of all of the composite layers produced by the PTA process were enhanced relative to those of the Ti6Al4V substrate. The homogeneity and volume fractions of the carbide phases in the composite layers were responsible for the improvement in the wear resistance of the alloy. The wear test results indicate that the alloy modified at 70 A shows better wear resistance than the alloys modified at 80 A and 90 A.},

Our results highlight how the grain size of the abrasive and the WC reinforcement particles both have a major abrasive effect. This contrasts starkly with the impact of the load applied and the environment, which have a far lesser effect and a very slight effect respectively.

Motivation for this article comes from computational models that are deterministic, complicated enough to make classical mathematical analysis impractical and that have a moderate-to-large number of inputs. The problem of designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have important effects on an output is considered. The proposed experimental plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational model.},

	abstract = {A computational model is a representation of some physical or other system of interest, first expressed mathematically and then implemented in the form of a computer program; it may be viewed as a function of inputs that, when evaluated, produces outputs. Motivation for this article comes from computational models that are deterministic, complicated enough to make classical mathematical analysis impractical and that have a moderate-to-large number of inputs. The problem of designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have important effects on an output is considered. The proposed experimental plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational model.},

Our results highlight how the grain size of the abrasive and the WC reinforcement particles both have a major abrasive effect. This contrasts starkly with the impact of the load applied and the environment, which have a far lesser effect and a very slight effect respectively. The relationship between these four factors and wear loss is described, and the mechanics of how wear takes place is discussed.},

	abstract = {Two Fe-based gas atomized powders, proposed to as metamorphic alloys (Armacor M and Armacor C), were weld-surfaced by the plasma transferred arc (PTA) process. The resultant deposits were subsequently characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and the microhardness tests. The wear performance of the two different coatings were investigated by the pin-on-disk dry sliding wear tests as well as three-body abrasive (DSRW) and two-body abrasive wear tests. Microstructural development during the solidification of each deposit is discussed. It is shown that Armacor M coating exhibits better wear performance than Armacor C coating for all wear testing investigated due to higher hardness and larger boride particles of Armacor M. The sliding wear resistance of both coatings follows a similar trend with the abrasive wear resistance. The wear rate of the pins for the pin-on-disk dry sliding wear testing is increased as the hardness of the counterpart disk is increased. It is also shown that wear rate and friction coefficient are the function of the applied stress. The XRD patterns in both the as-deposited coatings and worn surface do not show the presence of any significant amount of amorphous phase suggesting that crystalline–amorphous phase transformation has not occurred during the wear process.},

At present, majority of the fabrication industries use shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), and submerged arc welding (SAW) processes for hardfacing purposes. In these processes, the percentage of dilution level is higher, ranging between 10–30\%. In plasma transferred arc (PTA) hardfacing, a solidified metallurgical bond between deposit and substrate is obtained with minimum dilution (less than 10\%). This article highlights the application of response surface methodology (RSM) to predict and optimize the percentage of dilution of nickel based hardfaced surface produced by PTA process. The experiments were conducted based on five-factor, five levels central composite rotatable design with full replications technique and mathematical model was developed using RSM. Further, the RSM is used to optimize the process parameters that yield the lowest percentage of dilution.},

The microstructures of the hardfacing specimens are studied using, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) plus, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray techniques. The influence of VWC additive on the mechanical properties of the Co solid solution in Stellite 21 matrix is investigated with a nano-indentation technique. The hardness and wear resistance of the hardfacing specimens are evaluated on a Wilson Rockwell machine and a ball-on-disc tribometer, respectively. It is found that the hardness and wear resistance of the VWC/Stellite 21 composite layer are much higher than those of pure Stellite 21. The presence of the VWC reinforcement changes the microstructure of the Stellite 21 matrix and strengthens the Co solid solution.},

	abstract = {Plasma transferred arc (PTA) welded coatings are used to improve surface properties of mechanical parts. Advantages are the high reliability of the process and the low dilution of substrate and coating material. Processing of surfaces by PTA welding is restricted at the time to flat horizontal position. Furthermore, industry is interested in the development of strategies for coating with PTA in constraint position as complex three-dimensional (3D) parts could be then easily processed as well. Under commercial aspects, the process design can be optimized to increase process efficiency and to reduce heat input during the welding process. Process optimization involves the determination of guidelines for PTA welding in constraint positions as well. Modeling the process gives an alternative to reduce the experimental effort to optimize the welding process. Results of simulation studies of the PTA welding process are given in the present work. It will be shown that coating conditions can be optimized by varying plasma gas flow, heat input and heat flow, process speed, or powder injection with regard to welding in constraint positions. The defined controlling of the PTA welding allows modification of process management with less experimental effort and to develop coating strategies for processing in different positions. In experimental investigations, the developed coating strategies are confirmed by producing PTA coatings in constraint position as well as complex 3D parts.},

	abstract = {WC/Ni-based plasma transfer arc welded (PTAW) overlays are frequently used in the oil sands industry for applications requiring extremely high wear resistance.

These overlays usually consist of a dense distribution of either tungsten monocarbide (WC) or cast tungsten carbides (WC/W2C) in a NiBSi or NiCrBSi matrix.

A previous erosion–corrosion (E–C) study of cast tungsten carbide/NiBSi-based PTAW overlays not only highlighted the expected preferential E–C attack of the non Cr-bearing matrix but also the significantly greater effect that carbide dissolution of the cast tungsten carbides had on the overall E–C performance of the overlay.

It is recognised that cast tungsten carbide particles are more susceptible to dissolution during deposition than WC. As a result, a new process that modifies the outer periphery of cast tungsten carbides by producing a tungsten monocarbide shell has been developed. Overlays consisting of these carbides in a NiBSi binder were subsequently produced with the aim of reducing the extent of dissolution during deposition.

The aims of this study were (i) to assess the effectiveness of the tungsten monocarbide outer shell of cast tungsten carbides to resist dissolution during the PTAW deposition process; and (ii) to highlight any improvements in the E–C properties using a novel slurry pot erosion corrosion (SPEC) tester, which incorporates a three-electrode cell to enable the separate components of erosion, corrosion and synergy, to be established. Results were compared with a commercially available NiBSi PTAW overlay containing unmodified cast tungsten carbides.},

Company profiles have been arranged alphabetically according to the geographic zones including North America (Canada and the US), Europe, Japan, and the rest of the world by country. The profiles of the companies are also listed in the chapter that have either been provided by the companies, compiled from responses to letters and questionnaires, or from published sources. In addition, leading metal powder producers in each of the ferrous and non-ferrous categories are tabulated in the chapter according to the latest reported or estimated plant capacities. This method of ranking is chosen to overcome the difficulties of listing by sales volume, because these numbers are considered confidential. Also, in the non-ferrous category the wide differences in price of the various types of powders also make such comparisons of limited value.},

	abstract = {Plasma transferred arc (PTA) is now currently used for reclamation of worn materials or to provide wear or corrosion resistant coatings welded to the base material. Instead of injecting the powder in the plasma and the molten pool created at the coated surface, a tape casting process was used to obtain an adherent powder layer of NiCu (70:30) on the material surface. Tapes deposited on cast iron substrates exhibited a high electrical resistance (a few GΩ). Thus, their PTA treatment has been carried out by starting the electrical arc on the metallic cast iron substrates. The process control by charge coupled device (CCD) camera showed that the NiCu particles fell in the melting pool created at the substrate surface. The study of the obtained alloy compositions has shown the drastic influence of the initial binder concentration in the tape. Some NiCu tapes were sintered on their substrate at 1100°C for 4 h under an inert atmosphere. The resulting coatings, characterized by a low electrical resistance (a few Ω), and a good adhesion to the substrate, were then treated by PTA. The surfacing alloy properties were compared to those obtained without heat treatment.},

The synthesis of Fe–TiC metal matrix composite during metal deposition with laser and arc welding techniques is of technical and economic interest for hard surfacing of engineering components. Recent studies linked the resistance to abrasive wear with the size and morphology of TiC precipitates, which are strongly dependent on the deposition conditions and, more importantly, on the alloy chemistry. In this study, the effect of silicon and manganese on the TiC precipitates was explored and different processing conditions were assessed. The characterisation included optical and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and microhardness testing. The results indicate that silicon and manganese can have a significant effect on TiC size and morphology. Therefore, the composition of the matrix alloy offers an effective pathway to modify the microstructure of in-situ precipitated Fe–TiC metal matrix composites.},

	abstract = {Handing highly concentrated slurries is a common occurrence in the mining, oilsands and fertilizers industries among others. The combination of erosive and corrosive processes due to the presence of sand and mineral particles flowing in a corrosive fluid produces a high degradation rate of the hydrotransport equipment. Hardfacing overlays such as metal matrix composites (MMCs) can be used to protect equipment subjected to an erosion–corrosion process. The combination of a ductile matrix and a reinforcing hard phase makes them good candidates for these applications. The erosion–corrosion behavior of two tungsten carbide (WC)-MMCs is studied in this paper. Two variations of the NiCrBSi matrix with different concentration of chromium (Cr), carbon (C) and boron (B) were evaluated with and without reinforcing hard phase. The erosion–corrosion behavior was evaluated as a function of sand concentration and temperature. To determine the influence of the mechanical degradation the study was conducted using 1 and 5 wt.\% sand concentration. The overlays were evaluated at 20 and 65 °C and the velocity was kept at 14 m/s. Surface analysis was carried out to establish the degradation mechanisms after the erosion–corrosion tests. The two matrix materials showed differences in the microstructure, microhardness and erosion–corrosion resistance. The MMC with the harder matrix showed the lower mass loss and the erosive degradation was predominant in the overall erosion–corrosion process at the lower temperature. A different behavior was observed when the temperature of the testing solution was increased and a low sand concentration was used. Comparisons are made between the erosion–corrosion mechanisms of the two MMCs and the influence of the matrix in the overall degradation process is explained.},

High carbon ferrochromium, ferrotungsten, and nickel-aluminum intermetallic powders were combined to form M7C3 carbides inside Fe-based composite surface coating. The phase transformations on these coated surfaces were comprehensively examined by using a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectrometry microanalysis, differential thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The microstructure studies of the superficial layers of the coating revealed a phase mixture of interdendritic austenite (γ) phase structure and fine eutectic M7C3 carbides. The new formed coated surfaces were investigated by change of alloying elements (Cr, W, Ni), size of dendrites, change of eutectic reaction temperatures, hardness, carbide volume ratio of hard phases, and coating thickness as the processing parameters (powder feed rate and heat input). The dry sliding wear tests were performed on a pin on disc machine. The wear rates of the tests were affected by the powder feed rate, powder type, and applied load.

Coke forms on the internal walls of crude oil refining equipment and adversely affects its efficiency and service life. In an attempt to enhance the service life of materials exposed to these aggressive environments, this work investigated the development of a protective coating to reduce the diffusion of carbon into the surfaces of components. Coatings were tailored by mixing the atomized Ni alloy (Hastealloy C) with 5 wt\% and 15 wt\% Al powders and deposited by Plasma Transferred Arc hardfacing. Pack carburizing was carried out at 650 °C and 850 °C for 6 h, and temperature stability was tested in an air furnace to evaluate the performance of the coatings. Characterization included measurement of Vickers microhardness profiles and microstructure analysis by optical and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The good weldability of the original Ni-based alloy was not altered by the presence of Al. Richer Al coatings developed ordered aluminide compounds in a Ni matrix and exhibited increased hardness and dilution. Exposure to temperatures of 650 °C and 850 °C in an air furnace and to a carburizing environment neither compromised coating hardness nor produced a carburizing layer, although carbides were identified at the top surface. Our results will be of benefit in the development of an alternative solution for the protection of components operating in carburizing environments.},

The microstructure of the coatings was mainly γ-Fe matrix and (Cr, Fe)7C3 carbide reinforced phases.

An experimental campaign has been carried out on the deposition of two nickel- and a cobalt-base superalloys: Hastelloy 276, Inconel 625 and Stellite 6. Benchmarks of C-Mn steel have been chosen to test geometrical configurations that are critical for the application (corners and grooves). Specimen characterisation through liquid penetration inspection, optical- and scanning electron microscopy and microhardness tests proved that process parameters optimisation depends only on the geometrical configuration and not on the deposited alloy. This result suggests the importance of an accurate design of the reciprocal positioning and movement between the torch and the part to be coated, as a function of the deposition geometry.},

The performance of hardfaced material was evaluated by microstructure, chemical analysis and microhardness measurements. For the processing conditions tested, results showed that, for operating conditions that do not require elevated temperature, laser hardfacing shows the bests results, due to the refine solidification structure produced.

The steel matrix (SHS-free) coating and its composite (SHS-produced) coating reinforced by multiple ceramic particulates were developed by plasma transferred arc (PTA) overlay welding. 5\% and 10\% weight percentages of mixtures of aluminum (Al), titanium dioxide (TiO2), and boron oxide (B2O3) powders by sequence weight ratio of 9:8:7 were used as precursors. Aluminothermic reduction of these oxides, being highly exothermic in nature, essentially leads to a self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) of multiple ceramic particulate reinforced steel matrix composite coatings. Composite coatings have been subsequently characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) attachment, transmission electron microscope (TEM), nanoindentation, and sliding wear measurement. The results show that the hypoeutectic microstructure exists in the steel matrix coating where it consists of γ(Fe, Ni), M7C3, and (Fe, Cr)2B phases. Adding mixtures of Al–TiO2–B2O3 by sequence weight ratio of 9:8:7 changes its microstructure into pseudoeutectic characteristic whose crystal growth is cell dendrite in 5\% SHS-produced coating but dendrite in 10\% SHS-produced coating. Not only the metastable Al2O3 with nanometer and TiB2, but the TiB and TiC can be formed in the SHS-produced coating, except for those phases that existed in the steel matrix coating. Hardness and sliding wear resistance of the SHS-produced coatings increase in comparison with that of the steel matrix coating. The best sliding wear resistance can be obtained in the 5\% SHS-produced coating for its high ratio of hardness to elastic modulus.},

In Plasma Transferred Arc (PTA) hardfacing, a solidified metallurgical bond between the deposit and the substrate is obtained with minimum dilution (less than 10\%). This paper highlights the application of response surface methodology to predict and optimize the percentage of the dilution of a cobalt-based hardfaced surface produced by the PTA process. Experiments were conducted based on a fully replicable five-factor, five-level central composite rotatable design and a mathematical model was developed using response surface methodology. Furthermore, the response surface methodology was used to optimize the process parameters that yield the lowest percentage of dilution.},

The wear performance of the two different coatings were investigated by the pin-on-disk dry sliding wear tests as well as three-body abrasive (DSRW) and two-body abrasive wear tests. Microstructural development during the solidification of each deposit is discussed. It is shown that Armacor M coating exhibits better wear performance than Armacor C coating for all wear testing investigated due to higher hardness and larger boride particles of Armacor M. The sliding wear resistance of both coatings follows a similar trend with the abrasive wear resistance. The wear rate of the pins for the pin-on-disk dry sliding wear testing is increased as the hardness of the counterpart disk is increased. It is also shown that wear rate and friction coefficient are the function of the applied stress. The XRD patterns in both the as-deposited coatings and worn surface do not show the presence of any significant amount of amorphous phase suggesting that crystalline–amorphous phase transformation has not occurred during the wear process.},

The clad coating adheres with low carbon steel in a good metallurgical bonding and the rate of dilution is 15–20\%. Microstructural studies demonstrate that the coating possesses the metastable microstructure comprising the primary dendritic γ-austenite which is a non-equilibrium phase with an extended solid solution of alloying elements and interdendritic eutectic consisting of γ-austenite and (Cr,Fe)7C3 carbides. During the high temperature aging at 1253 K for 2 h, the fine spherical (Cr,Fe)23C6 carbide nucleates within (Cr,Fe)7C3 carbide and austenite matrix, and some martensite (α) also forms during cooling. The solidification and evolution sequence of the phase can be represented as follows: L → γ + L → γ + (γ + (Cr,Fe)7C3) → (γ + (Cr,Fe)23C6 + α). Due to the precipitation of (Cr,Fe)23C6 carbide and uniform distribution of carbide in the as-aged coating, the average hardness becomes higher than that of the as-clad coating.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the use of the Taguchi-regression method in developing the optimal plasma transferred arc welding (PTAW) process for obtaining high hardfacing quality characteristics. An “optimal” process means that the best performance characteristic would be produced while the least number of process parameters are involved. In the experimental tests, the surface hardening process is conducted using Cobalt-based and Nickel-based powdery metal materials together with L18 orthogonal arrays. The dependent variable, wear, obeys the-smaller-the-better quality characteristic, and the performance statistics, the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), are obtainable. The experimental results show that the most efficient process parameters based on analysis of variance are set as follows: hardfacing material, the accelerating voltage, the powder feed rate , and the pre-heat treatment temperature. They account for almost 90\% of the total variance of wear. Under the optimal setting, the average error rates for using Taguchi and Taguchi-regression methods are 7.05 and 5.50\%, respectively. The outcome of the experiment indicates that predicted values of the optimal setting fit well with the actual data. The reproducibility of the optimal plasma transfer arc hardfacing is obtained from the experimental data of the confirmation run. A reliable analysis based on the results from plasma transfer arc hardfacing conditions can be achieved through the Taguchi-regression method.},

	abstract = {Tungsten carbide-based metal matrix composite coatings are deposited by PTAW (Plasma Transferred Arc Welding) on production critical components in oil sands mining. Homogeneous distribution of the reinforcement particles is desirable for optimal wear resistance in order to reduce unplanned maintenance shutdowns. The homogeneity of the coating can be improved by controlling the heat transfer, solidification rate of the process and the volume fraction of carbide.
The degree of settling of the particles in the deposit was quantified using image analysis. The volume fraction of carbide was the most significant factor in obtaining a homogeneous coating. Lowering the current made a modest improvement in homogeneity. Changes made in other operational parameters did not effect significant changes in homogeneity.
Infrared thermography was used to measure the temperature of the surface of the deposit during the welding process. The emissivity of the materials was required to acquire true temperature readings. The emissivity of the deposit was measured using laser reflectometry and was found to decrease from 0.8 to 0.2 as the temperature increased from 900°C to 1200°C. A correction algorithm was applied to calculate the actual temperature of the surface of the deposit. The corrected temperature did increase as the heat input of the weld increased.
A one dimensional mathematical model of the settling profile and solidification of the coatings was developed. The model considers convective and radiative heat input from the plasma, the build-up of the deposit, solidification of the deposit and the settling of the WC particles within the deposit. The model had very good agreement with the experimental results of the homogeneity of the carbide as a function of depth. This fundamental model was able to accurately predict the particle homogeneity of an MMC deposited by an extremely complicated process. It was shown that the most important variable leading to a homogeneous coating is to operate at the packing saturation limit of the reinforcement. In the case of the MMC explored, a fully homogeneous coating was obtained with 50 vol\% WC in a NiCrBSi matrix.},

The microhardness profile of the composite coating along the depth direction was measured, while its cross-sectional microstructures and phase compositions were analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Moreover, the friction and wear behavior of the composite coatings sliding against Si3N4 from ambient to 800 °C was evaluated using a ball-on-disc friction and wear tester, and the worn surface morphologies of the composite coatings and counterpart ceramic balls were observed using a scanning electron microscope. At the same time, the worn surfaces of the ceramic balls were also analyzed using a 3D non-contact surface mapping profiler as well. It was found that the laser cladding Ni/hBN coating on the stainless steel substrate had high microhardness and good friction-reducing and antiwear abilities at elevated temperatures up to 800 °C. The composite coating registered slightly increased friction coefficient and wear rate as the temperature rose from ambient to 100 °C; then the friction coefficient and wear rate decreased with increasing temperature up to 800 °C (with the slight increase in the wear rate at 700 °C and 800 °C to be an exception). The laser cladding Ni/hBN coating was dominated by mixed adhesion and abrasive wear as it slid against the ceramic ball below 300 °C. With further increase in the test temperature up to 400 °C and above, it was characterized by mild adhesion wear and plastic deformation. Since the laser cladding Ni/hBN coating registered an increased wear rate at temperatures of 600 °C and above, it was not suggested to be used for wear prevention and protection of the stainless steel at elevated temperature above 800 °C.},

This chapter discusses coatings and surface engineering, which are used to protect manufactured components from thermal or corrosive degradation, impart wear resistance and hardness to the surface while retaining the toughness and ductility of the bulk component, and enhance the aesthetic appeal. Many factors must be considered in selecting coatings for a given application. There is no such thing as a universal coating that can be used under all conditions. Coatings are not inherently good or bad, and all coating selections represent compromises made to satisfy all the variables involved. The process of selecting coatings must consider the operating conditions, material compatibility issues, nature and surface preparation of substrate, time or speed of application, cost, safety, environmental effects, coating properties, and structural design. Selecting the right coating is a process of elimination rather than selection. The process of designing and developing coatings for modern technological applications combines experimentation and analysis.},

More detailed information about the crystallographic structure and phase compositions of the deposited coatings was obtained with the application of Rietveld refinement method to analyze XRD spectra. It was found that the addition of Mo did not lead to a change in phase compositions. Furthermore, it can also be seen that the relative contents of the total Cr-rich compounds increased from 36 wt.\% to 45 wt.\%, though the M23C6 type carbide increased but the relative contents of the M7C3 type carbide decreased with the increasing of Mo contents from 0 wt.\% to 6 wt.\%. The component segregation, which existed in the Mo-free coating, decreased gradually then disappeared finally with the increasing of Mo contents. The morphology of Cr-rich compounds observed in the interdendritic region changed from plate-like to net-like, as well as the refinement of Ni-rich dendrites because of the addition of Mo. The wear resistance increased but the microhardness decreased with the increasing of Mo contents from 0 wt.\% to 6 wt.\%.

Advantages are the high reliability of the process and the low dilution of substrate and coating material. Processing of surfaces by PTA welding is restricted at the time to flat horizontal position. Furthermore, industry is interested in the development of strategies for coating with PTA in constraint position as complex three-dimensional (3D) parts could be then easily processed as well. Under commercial aspects, the process design can be optimized to increase process efficiency and to reduce heat input during the welding process. Process optimization involves the determination of guidelines for PTA welding in constraint positions as well. Modeling the process gives an alternative to reduce the experimental effort to optimize the welding process. Results of simulation studies of the PTA welding process are given in the present work. It will be shown that coating conditions can be optimized by varying plasma gas flow, heat input and heat flow, process speed, or powder injection with regard to welding in constraint positions. The defined controlling of the PTA welding allows modification of process management with less experimental effort and to develop coating strategies for processing in different positions. In experimental investigations, the developed coating strategies are confirmed by producing PTA coatings in constraint position as well as complex 3D parts.},

	abstract = {In this work, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)-embedded 316L stainless steel (SS316L/h-BN) composites were prepared using a conventional powder metallurgy process. In order to produce self-lubricating composites, various amounts of h-BN (10, 15 and 20 vol\%) were incorporated. Effects of h-BN content and sintering temperature on the mechanical and tribological properties were of primary interest. The results suggested that an increase in h-BN content reduced the hardness of the composites, but that the hardness could be improved by increasing the sintering temperature. Addition of h-BN up to 20 vol\% improved the friction coefficient of the composites. At a sintering temperature of 1250 °C, h-BN transformed into a boride liquid phase, which formed a eutectic during cooling and exhibited a deterioration effect on lubricating film formation of the h-BN, resulting in an increase in the friction coefficient of the composites. The specific wear rate was greatly reduced when the composites were sintered at 1200 °C. The lowest friction coefficient and specific wear rate in the composites could be found under the experimental conditions used in this work when using 20 vol\% of h-BN at a sintering temperature of 1200 °C.},

	abstract = {Endurance athletes, including but not limited to cyclists, runners, triathletes, mountain bikers, and cross-country skiers, have unique and often challenging daily nutritional needs. In fact, the intense and exhaustive endeavors that endurance athletes undertake daily are impossible unless the right foods are eaten in optimal amounts at the correct time. In addition, meeting fluid and fuel needs during exercise—for example, while running a marathon or competing in an Ironman triathlon or multiday adventure race—is another skill the endurance athlete must master. Nagging injuries, frequent upper respiratory illnesses, and slow recovery from training bouts can all signal that an endurance athlete’s nutrition program is out of sync with their training program. Common challenges faced by endurance athletes include consuming adequate calories, consuming enough of certain key nutrients such as iron, protein, and calcium, and timing food intake around exercise. Endurance athletes who follow a vegetarian eating style as well as those struggling with disordered eating and body image concerns may find it particularly difficult to meet their nutritional needs. This chapter focuses on this specific group of athletes and their nutritional requirements.},

Several of these supplements are marketed not only to aid performance but also to combat the immunosuppressive effects of intense endurance training.

Based on the experiment results it is found that Fe–B4C composite coatings can only be prepared by PTA powder surfacing in the case that the employed surfacing current is little enough. The metallurgical reactions between Fe and B4C are limited in a very narrow region at their contacting interface in this case. With the increasing of employed surfacing current more and more B4C particles will be fully melted and reacted with the liquid iron-based alloys. However, the products of the metallurgical reactions between them are various for the different powder compositions and surfacing conditions. Most of the B4C particles will be fully melted during the PTA powder surfacing while 200 A or greater surfacing current is used. Furthermore, most of the C element in B4C particles is tending to be graphite rather than reacting with Fe to be carbides during the processing under the Fe–B4C composite powder PTA surfacing conditions.},

It was shown that this method is an easy and effective technique in producing uniform alloyed layers with a thickness of about 1.5 mm and a hardness between 1000 and 1300 HV. The microstructure of the borided surfaces consists of primary Fe2B-type borides and a eutectic mixture of borides and martensite. Some cracks are observed in the eutectic regions but they do not seem to critically affect the behaviour of the coatings in sliding wear. The wear rate of pin on disc tests is primarily affected by the applied load and it lies between 10−5 mm3/m for low loads and 10−2 mm3/m for high loads. Two distinct regimes of mild and severe wear are obtained separated by a critical load. Mild wear is due to the load supporting effect of borides and severe wear is due to their breakage above a critical load. The wear rate is not significantly affected by the sliding velocity and is consistent with the friction coefficient. The friction coefficient varies from 0.13 to 0.23 and depends strongly on the oxidation status of the wear track. The sliding velocity affects the sliding distance where the coefficient of friction reaches equilibrium.},

	abstract = {Hadfield’s manganese steel, nominally Fe–1.2\%C–13\%Mn, is an alloy of inherent toughness, work-hardening characteristics and excellent resistance to some types of adhesive and abrasive wear. However, due to its low yield strength, it may be deformed markedly before its work-hardening become effective. In certain applications, such as railroad crossings and rock-crushers, this can be a disadvantage. In practice, when this deformation becomes excessive, welding is employed to restore the casting to its original dimensions. During welding, precautions have to be taken to avoid overheating and the attendant carbide precipitation which may lead to subsequent early failure. Three different electrode compositions were used to overlay-weld austenitic manganese steel cast in the form of rail heads. Two of the electrodes were obtained commercially and the third was of novel chemical composition and was produced in our laboratory. Mechanical tests were then carried out to simulate the battering deformation likely to result from in-service exposure. The procedure highlighted the work-hardening characteristics and resistance to plastic flow of the weld deposit and base material, one of which consisted of the standard Hadfield’s alloy whilst two others had minor transition element additions. The electrode containing molybdenum produced a weld overlay which showed better work-hardening characteristics and deformation resistance than those of the other two commercial electrodes studied.},

	abstract = {The friction and wear that occurs between wheel and rail exacts millions of dollars out of maintenance budgets each year. Standard lubrication practices have been found to be unreliable in effectively lubricating curved track sections. Consequently, a method of reducing cost and increasing rail life is of significance to the railroad industry. Through the use of self-lubricating materials and thermal spray technology a composite surface coating was developed.
A 1080 steel coating provided a wear-resistant matrix, in which to incorporate solid lubricants. The 1080 steel coating was found to provide increased wear resistance and some friction reduction (\${\textbackslash}mu\$ = 0.46 vs. \${\textbackslash}mu\$ = 0.5-0.7 for uncoated rail). The reduced wear stems from the coatings resistance to degenerate into severe wear modes. The wear rate of uncoated rail steel can be an order of magnitude greater than that of a 1080 steel coating.
Three solid lubricant/steel coating systems were investigated; graphite incorporated into 1080 steel, copper incorporated into 1080 steel, and various polymers deposited over a 1080 steel coating. The structure of the coatings were evaluated by metallography and wear performance. Metallographic analysis included optical, SEM, and FIB. Polymer film analysis was performed with FTIR. Wear testing and friction measurement were accomplished with the Amsler twin disk wear testing machine. Coatings were tested against class C wheel steel at 5\% and 35\% slide/roll ratios, with contact pressures ranging from 700 to 1315 N/mm\${\textbackslash}sp2.\$
The work identified unique wear mechanisms for each coating system. The friction reduction and durability of the graphite/steel coatings was good at low slide/roll ratios. The copper/steel coatings were unable to control friction and had limited life. The polymer/steel coatings, particularly nylon/steel, had excellent performance at a wide range of slide/roll ratios and contact pressures. The nylon/1080 steel coatings were applied to rail sections for large scale and field testing.},

The microstructure, flowability and apparent density of the composite powder, as well as the structure and mechanical properties of the plasma sprayed coating were characterized. The friction and wear behavior of the NiCr/Cr3C2–NiCr/hBN coating from ambient temperature up to 800 °C was evaluated on a ball-on-disk wear tester and compared with that of NiCr/Cr3C2 coating and NiCr/Cr3C2–NiCr/BaF2·CaF2 coating. The results show that NiCr cladding can reduce the decarburization of Cr3C2 and oxidation of hBN during the thermal spray. The main wear mechanisms of the NiCr/Cr3C2–NiCr/hBN composite coating are ploughing and adhesive wear. Layered hexagonal BN particle reduce the direct contact and severe adhesion between friction pairs, thus decreasing the friction coefficient. The NiCr/Cr3C2–NiCr/hBN composite coating shows a promising application in the high temperature environment with the request of both wear resistance and friction reduction.},

So wear is an important tribological phenomenon while studying the failure of components. The observed frequent failure of crown and pinion due to wear and fatigue lead to this study on effect of cryogenic treatment on the wear resistance of case carburized steel (En 353). This paper deals with the pin on disk wear test without lubrication as per ASTM standard, designation: G 99-95A. The test was carried out for three different load conditions and seven sliding speeds for the samples, which has undergone three different treatment conditions namely conventional heat treatment (CHT), shallow cryogenic treatment (SCT) and deep cryogenic treatment (DCT). It has been found that the wear resistance has been considerably increased due to shallow cryogenic treatment and deep cryogenic treatment includes much more improvement in wear resistance when compared to conventional heat treatment. Also it is concluded that for better wear resistance, it is advisable to go for deep cryogenic treatment. The results are consistent with the previous studies reported in the literature on cryogenic treatments for other materials.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
FeCrBSi alloy powders without and with 2–6 wt.\% Mo (Mo-free and Mo-added, respectively) were deposited on a plain steel using plasma transferred arc (PTA) hardfacing. The effects of Mo addition on the microstructure and properties of the FeCrBSi alloy coating were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) attachment, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Vickers hardness tester, hydraulic universal testing machine, dry sand abrasion test (DSAT) and water quenching method. The results show that the Mo-free coating consists of γ (Fe, Ni), M7(C, B)3, and (Fe, Cr)2B phases. Adding Mo leads to the formation of M23(C, B)6, Mo2(B, C) and Fe3Mo3(C, B) phases, except for those phases existed in the Mo-free coating. The twinning with 10 1 ¯ twinning plane is observed in the orthorhombic M7(C, B)3 (M = Fe, Cr, Mo) phase. A hypoeutectic microstructure can be seen in the Mo-free and 2 wt.\% Mo-added coatings. Increasing Mo addition to 4 wt.\% and 6 wt.\%, a hypereutectic microstructure can be obtained. The microstructure of the Mo-free coating can be refined after adding 2–6 wt.\% Mo. The finest microstructure can be obtained in the 4 wt.\% Mo-added coating. Adding Mo in the FeCrBSi alloy coating can increase its abrasive wear resistance that has no direct relation with H/E or H3/E2 because brittle fracture occurred occasionally in the abrasive wear test. The thermal shock resistance of the Mo-free coating can be improved after adding 2–6 wt.\% Mo. The best abrasive wear resistance and thermal shock resistance can be received in the 4 wt.\% Mo-added coating.},

	abstract = {The plasma transferred arc (PTA) technique was used to produce composite coatings based on co-melting of MoS2, TiC and iron ingredients, in an attempt to obtain wear resistant layers with self lubricating properties. As a matter of fact, both molybdenum and titanium are known to form with sulfur either crystalline or amorphous compounds exhibiting special self lubricating properties. In this perspective three coatings containing the same quantity of TiC and increasing MoS2 contents were produced using plain carbon steel material as the substrate. Three other coatings containing only increasing contents of MoS2 without TiC were prepared under the same conditions for comparison. The experiments have shown that both TiC and MoS2 ingredients dissolve completely in the melt under the plasma arc, whereas their elements, Ti, C and S, are redistributed in the solidification products forming new compounds. The influence of the presence of sulfur in the solidification path of the Fe–Ti(Mo)–C system is studied. Although the original MoS2 compound is totally absent in the final microstructure, the composites containing both MoS2 and TiC have formed new complex sulfides, presumably endowed with self lubricating properties. As a result, the wear tests performed with a pin-on-disk apparatus have shown that the coatings which were produced using both TiC and MoS2 ingredients exhibited improved friction coefficients and lower wear rates in comparison to the steel substrate as well as to the composite containing TiC, but exempted from MoS2.},

The arguments often focus on whether moral enhancement is morally permissible, or even obligatory, and remain largely in the realm of the hypothetical. This paper proposes that psilocybin may represent a viable, practical option for moral enhancement and that its further research in the context of moral psychology could comprise the next step in the development of moral transhumanism.},

In this study, samples of W9Mo3Cr4V (W9) high speed steel (HSS) were treated at various sub-zero temperatures before and after tempering, respectively. The main objective of this work is to investigate the effect of the sub-zero treatment condition on mechanical properties and wear resistance of the W9 HSS and correlate it to variations in microstructure. Microstructures of the treated samples were characterized with electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), and corresponding properties, including hardness, impact toughness and wear resistance, were evaluated. It was demonstrated that the mechanical properties of the cryogenically treated samples were superior to those of conventionally treated ones. The cryogenically treated samples with subsequent tempering performed better than cryogenically treated samples that experienced prior tempering. The lower temperatures for sub-zero treatment were more effective in improving the mechanical properties. The life of W9 HSS taps in cutting 30CrMnTi steel was assessed, which showed a trend similar to that observed during wear testing. Efforts are made to clarify possible mechanisms responsible for the improvements.},

	abstract = {Medical Education 2011: 45: 1101–1110Context The superiority of retesting over restudying in terms of knowledge retention and skills acquisition has been proven in both laboratory and classroom settings, as well as in doctors’ practice. However, it is still unclear how important retesting strategies are to the learning of relevant factual knowledge in undergraduate medical education.Methods Eighty students in Years 3–5 of medical school in Munich participated in a prospective, randomised, double-blinded, controlled study in which they were exposed to 30 electronic flashcards designed to help them memorise key factual knowledge in the domain of clinical nephrology. The flashcards were presented in four successive learning cycles, each consisting of a study period and a subsequent test period. Half of all participants were randomised to repetitive studying (restudy group) and half were randomised to repetitive testing (retest group) of successfully memorised flashcards. Knowledge retention was assessed after 1 week and 6 months. Additionally, personal data, self-reflection on the efficacy of the learning strategies and judgements of learning were obtained by questionnaires.Results Repetitive testing promoted better recall than repetitive studying after 1 week (p {\textless} 0.001). However, after 6 months general recall was poor and no difference between the restudy and retest groups was observed. Time on task and number of trials, in addition to sex, age, performance and psycho-social background, did not vary between the groups. Self-predictions of student performance did not correlate with actual performance.Conclusions In the context of using electronic flashcards, repetitive testing is a more potent learning strategy than repetitive studying for short-term but not long-term knowledge retention in clinical medical students. Although students use testing as a learning strategy, they seem to be unaware of its superiority in supporting short-term knowledge retention.},

	abstract = {Override simulations of two train units in frontal collision have been carried out using multi-body dynamics. The aim of this paper is to investigate the possible factors influencing the overriding behaviour throughout frontal collisions. In addition to the initial vertical offset defined in the standard EN 15227, the pitching motion of vehicles has a great effect on the overriding phenomenon.

Since the traction and braking forces are distributed along the motor unit, coupler forces occuring during operation are considered to be low. In most cases, this is actually true. However, towing away a defect motor unit by another motor unit can lead to high forces due to longitudinal vibrations, which may ultimately lead to a failure of the coupler or superstructure. Investigations on the behaviour of motor units operating in an European city have been carried out for about 3 years [Kühnel, A., Hecht, M., Udriste-Breazu, I., Geike, T. and Böhme, C., Kräfte beim Bergen liegengebliebener U-Bahnen—ein unterschätztes Risiko.

A two-dimensional finite element model is developed which accurately determines the normal stress, contact length, and approach distance of layered surfaces. Numerical results, which are initially verified using Hertzian theory, are obtained at 756 distinct conditions by varying coating material, coating thickness, normal load, cylinder radius, and cylinder material. The numerical results are normalized with respect to Hertzian contact theory and a dimensionless anisotropic coating material parameter, ζ, is introduced. Numerical expressions for the normalized maximum normal stress, contact length, and approach distance are subsequently determined by curve-fitting the results of the 756 simulations performed. The relevance of such expressions are ascertained and discussed by comparing predicted results to isotropic layer theory presented by Gupta and Walowit [P.K. Gupta, J.A. Walowit.

In this work, the contact characteristics of transversely isotropic coatings are investigated using the finite element method.

Using the model, contact behavior is evaluated over a diverse range of transversely isotropic coating materials and thicknesses. Verified numerical results are obtained at 297 distinct operating conditions by varying coating material (SiC, NbSe2, Graphite, Al2O3, Cadnium, Cobalt, GaS, GaSe2, InSe2, MoS2), coating thickness (10–100 μm), normal load (200–20,000 N/m), and cylinder radii (0.005–0.015 m). Based on the finite element results, numerical expressions are derived as a function of a transversely isotropic coating parameter, ζ, for the maximum surface pressure, contact length, and approach distance.

	abstract = {The anisotropic friction, deformation and fracture behavior of singlecrystal SiC surfaces were investigated in two categories. The first is that in which friction and wear of SiC arises primarily from adhesion between sliding solid surfaces in contact and the second is where friction and wear of SiC occur as a result of the surface sliding against a hard particle. The categories are called adhesive and abrasive wear processes respectively. In the adhesive wear process the adhesion, friction and wear of SiC are markedly dependent on crystallographic orientation. The force to re-establish the shearing fracture of an adhesive bond at the interface between SiC and a metal is the lowest in the preferred orientation of the SiC slip system. The fracturing of SiC occurs near the adhesive bond to the metal and it is due to primary cleavages of both prismatic \{101\&amp;\#x0304;0\} and basal \{0001\} planes. In the abrasion process of SiC the 〈101\&amp;\#x0304;0〉 direction on the basal plane exhibits the lowest coefficient of friction and the greatest resistance to abrasion for SiC. The anisotropic friction and plastic deformation are primarily controlled by the slip system \{101\&amp;\#x0304;0\} 〈112\&amp;\#x0304;0〉. The anisotropic fracture in the abrasion process is due to primary cleavages of \{0001\}, \{101\&amp;\#x0304;0\} and \{112\&amp;\#x0304;0\} planes.},

	abstract = {Contact problems are central to Solid Mechanics, because contact is the principal method of applying loads to a deformable body and the resulting stress concentration is often the most critical point in the body. Contact is characterized by unilateral inequalities, describing the physical impossibility of tensile contact tractions (except under special circumstances) and of material interpenetration. Additional inequalities and/or non-linearities are introduced when friction laws are taken into account. These complex boundary conditions can lead to problems with existence and uniqueness of quasi-static solution and to lack of convergence of numerical algorithms. In frictional problems, there can also be lack of stability, leading to stick–slip motion and frictional vibrations. If the material is non-linear, the solution of contact problems is greatly complicated, but recent work has shown that indentation of a power-law material by a power law punch is self-similar, even in the presence of friction, so that the complete history of loading in such cases can be described by the (usually numerical) solution of a single problem. Real contacting surfaces are rough, leading to the concentration of contact in a cluster of microscopic actual contact areas. This affects the conduction of heat and electricity across the interface as well as the mechanical contact process. Adequate description of such systems requires a random process or statistical treatment and recent results suggest that surfaces possess fractal properties that can be used to obtain a more efficient mathematical characterization. Contact problems are very sensitive to minor profile changes in the contacting bodies and hence are also affected by thermoelastic distortion. Important applications include cases where non-uniform temperatures are associated with frictional heating or the conduction of heat across a non-uniform interface. The resulting coupled thermomechanical problem can be unstable, leading to a rich range of physical phenomena. Other recent developments are also briefly surveyed, including examples of anisotropic materials, elastodynamic problems and fretting fatigue.},

The model is implemented in the DYNA3D three-dimensional explicit finite element code. The phenomenological study shows the importance of taking micromechanical effects into account to model macroscopic failure of the material. The constitutive model relates damage to microscopic parameters (size of microcracks, cracks density etc.) and takes loading-induced anisotropy damage into account by correlating microcrack growth to preferential orientations. The unilateral character (behaviour difference between tension and compression) is treated by the microcrack growth criterion. The progressive reduction in material stiffness due to the presence of microcracks is modelled using Margolin's effective modulus expressions, and the material is pulverised if the microcrack density exceeds a critical value. Determination of the energy dissipated by damage is proposed. The constitutive model applied to SiC/SiAlYON ceramics is validated by a comparaison of the results between a Hopkinson's Bar Test and numerical simulation. Comparing the macroscopic brittle model results with the damage model results shows the ability of the second to predict microcrack effects on the dynamic failure behaviour of ceramics.},

By tailoring the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, we created an attractively interacting ensemble of ultracold bosons at negative temperature that is stable against collapse for arbitrary atom numbers. The quasimomentum distribution develops sharp peaks at the upper band edge, revealing thermal equilibrium and bosonic coherence over several lattice sites. Negative temperatures imply negative pressures and open up new parameter regimes for cold atoms, enabling fundamentally new many-body states.},

One can already see this in the fact that one can imagine friction without wear, at least in a model. For example, there is friction, but no wear in the Prandtl-Tomlinson model. Even wear without friction can be envisioned: wear can already be caused by a normal contact without tangential movement.},

It inhibits direct contact between two bodies and, thereby, replaces dry friction with fluid friction. The presence of liquid between two bodies influences not only the tangential, but also the normal forces: two dry sheets of glass can effortlessly be taken apart from one another, while in order to take two wet sheets apart one needs a considerable force. This phenomenon can be attributed, on the one hand, to capillary forces, and on the other, to pure hydrodynamic nature: a viscous liquid requires a given time in order to flow in the small space between two sheets. During dynamic loading, this phenomenon leads to an apparent “adhesion” between two lubricated bodies, which we describe as “viscous adhesion.”},

Because the real contact area is, as a rule, only a fraction of the apparent contact area, the heat released in a tribological contact is very heterogeneous. The local temperature increases can be so high that they may influence the material properties and can even cause the material to melt. Furthermore, a local change in the temperature leads to a local heat expansion and, thus, a corresponding change in the contact conditions. This feedback reaction can, under certain conditions, lead to the development of thermo-mechanical instabilities in the contact. In this chapter, we investigate the various aspects of the frictionally caused heat release in tribological contacts.},

Reynolds investigated rolling contact mechanics early on 1. He established through experimental investigations that in rolling contact both sliding and sticking domains exist in the contact area. For increasing driving or braking moments, the sliding domain expands until finally the entire contact area is sliding. This sliding leads to the translational speed of the wheel no longer being equal to the circumferential speed Ω R. The difference in the two speeds is called the creep speed and plays an important role in contact mechanics.},

Initially, if two bodies with rough surfaces are pressed together, the “real” contact area is much smaller than the “apparent” contact area. The size of the “real” contact area determines, for example, the electrical and thermal resistance between the bodies. The size of the contact area and the maximum stress ultimately determines the size of the wear particles and therefore the rate of wear. The size of the real contact area is also a crucial factor in frictional processes. The cause of frictional forces can be visualized as the fracturing of microscopic bonds between the contacting bodies. The fracture strength, and therefore the frictional force, should be, according to this viewpoint, approximately proportionally to the “real” contact area. In this chapter, we will investigate the dependence of the contact area, length, and overall configuration on the normal force.},

It was made evident, most notably through the works of Grosch (1962), that rubber friction is very closely related to internal friction. This is proven by the fact that the temperature dependence of the coefficient of friction correlates with the temperature dependence of the complex shear modulus. This is a sign that rubber friction is a volume property.},

There are several methods to induce directional motion based on exploiting the interactions between vibrations and friction. For example, methods of transportation and separation of mixtures using vibration belong to this category.

It encompasses elastic and plastic deformations of the surface layers of the contacting bodies, interactions with wear particles, micro-fractures and the restoration of the continuity of materials, excitation of electrons and phonons, chemical reactions, and the transfer of particles from one body to the other. What is astonishing is the fact that it is possible to formulate a very simple law for dry friction. This first order approximation is sufficient for many engineering applications: The frictional force is proportional to the normal force and as good as independent from the speed. The astounding property of dry friction lies in the fact that in a first order approximation, it is dependent neither on contact area nor on roughness. This property allows us to use the notion of the coefficient of friction. The coefficient of friction, however, gives only a very rough first approximation of the quotient of frictional force to normal force.},

As a preparatory step, we will summarize a few results of the theory of elasticity that have a direct application to contact mechanics. We consider the deformations in an elastic half-space, which are caused by a given stress acting upon its surface. The calculation of the deformation of an elastic body whose surface is being acted upon by a force (“direct problem of the theory of elasticity”) is much easier than the solution of contact problems, because in the latter, neither the stress distribution, nor the contact area are known to begin with. The classic solutions from Hertz (non-adhesive contact) and Johnson, Kendall, and Roberts (adhesive contact) use the known solutions for “direct problems” as building blocks to the construction of a solution for a contact problem.},

Bradley presented the solution 50 years later for adhesive normal contact between a rigid sphere and a rigid plane. The resulting adhesive force was found to be F A = 4π γ R, where γ is the surface energy. The solution for the adhesive contact between elastic bodies was presented in 1971 by Johnson, Kendall, and Roberts (JKR-Theory). They obtained F A = 3π γ R for the adhesive force. Derjaguin, Müller, and Toporov published an alternative adhesive theory in 1975, which is known as the DMT-Theory. After an intense discussion in 1976 Tabor came to the realization that the JKR-Theory and the DMT-Theory are both correct and are special cases of the general problem. For absolutely rigid bodies the theory from Bradley is valid; for small, rigid spheres DMT-Theory is valid; and for large, flexible spheres JKR-Theory. The difference between all of these cases, however, is very minor and the JKR-Theory describes adhesion relatively well, even in the scope of the DMT-Theory. Perhaps this is why JKR-Theory is used so prevalently to describe adhesive contacts. For this reason, we will also limit ourselves in this chapter to the presentation of the theory from Johnson, Kendall, and Roberts.},

	abstract = {High speed trains in the northern area of Japan use alloyed cast iron brake blocks including nickel (Ni) and molybdenum (Mo). Reducing the Ni and Mo contents of the alloyed cast iron brake blocks would be beneficial because they are rare metals with variable prices. Ni and Mo play important roles in increasing the friction coefficient and decreasing the wear of brake blocks at high speeds. Brake blocks with reduced contents of these metals must maintain a sufficient friction coefficient and wear characteristics at high speeds. Cast iron composite brake blocks with reduced Ni and Mo contents were prepared using two types of alumina: aluminum titanate and silicon carbide foams to maintain the friction coefficient and decrease the wear characteristics at high speeds. These blocks were tested on a full-scale dynamometer, and the friction and wear performance of one of the best performing blocks were tested under real operating conditions. The friction coefficients of all reduced Ni, Mo cast iron composite brake blocks were higher than those of conventional blocks at high speeds. The wear of the reduced Ni, Mo cast iron composite brake blocks containing alumina blended with aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) foam was significantly decreased as compared with that of conventional blocks. Under real operation, the friction coefficients of conventional and reduced Ni, Mo brake blocks were similar under normal braking conditions, but those of conventional brake blocks were lower than those of the reduced Ni, Mo blocks under emergency braking conditions. The lower friction coefficient of conventional brake blocks under emergency braking conditions is likely caused by the adhesion of wear particles to the wheel tread. While the wheel tread was not worn by conventional brake blocks, it was worn by the reduced Ni, Mo blocks under emergency braking conditions.},

In order to produce self-lubricating composites, various amounts of h-BN (10, 15 and 20 vol\%) were incorporated. Effects of h-BN content and sintering temperature on the mechanical and tribological properties were of primary interest. The results suggested that an increase in h-BN content reduced the hardness of the composites, but that the hardness could be improved by increasing the sintering temperature. Addition of h-BN up to 20 vol\% improved the friction coefficient of the composites. At a sintering temperature of 1,250°C, h-BN transformed into a boride liquid phase, which formed a eutectic during cooling and exhibited a deterioration effect on lubricating film formation of the h-BN, resulting in an increase in the friction coefficient of the composites. The specific wear rate was greatly reduced when the composites were sintered at 1,200°C. The lowest friction coefficient and specific wear rate in the composites could be found under the experimental conditions used in this work when using 20 vol\% of h-BN at a sintering temperature of 1,200°C.},

This innovative application of AR has the potential to improve construction practices, and in this case, facility management.},

The purpose was to investigate the functioning of today's Automotive Service Technicians (ASTs) training in order to inform the design of an Augmented Reality (AR) teaching aid. The first part of the paper presents a literature review of some major problems encountered by ASTs today. The benefits of AR as technological aid are also introduced. Then, the methodology and the results of two case studies are presented. The first study is based on interviews with trainers and trainees; the second one on observations in real training settings. The results support the assumption that today's ASTs' training could be regarded as a community-of-practice (CoP). Therefore, AR could be useful as a collaboration tool, offering a shared virtual representation of real vehicle's parts, which are normally invisible unless dismantled (e.g. the parts of a hydraulic automatic transmission). We conclude on the methods and the technologies to support the automotive CoP.},

The contribution lies in two aspects: firstly, an environment utilizing web3D is demonstrated, in which on-site images are rendered to box nodes and registered with virtual objects through a three-step method; secondly, it is further extended to be “cloud” through federation of BIM (building information modeling) and BSNS (business social networking services). Technical solutions to key issues such as authoring, publishing, and composition are designed.

For campus touring purposes, AR enhances users learning interest, and therefore reinforces learning. To explore how AR mobile learning can help visitors become familiar with an environment, a smart phone AR implementation tool, Layar, was used. A prototype campus touring system for Fu-Jen Catholic University was developed and reviewed by two focus groups (freshmen). Interview data were collected. The thoughts and reactions from these two focus groups were summarized. Findings of the research reveal that the smart phone AR campus touring system provides hidden information in a real environment, giving freshmen instant assistance if they have gotten lost, and is a good personal mobile learning tool.

	abstract = {This article is a revised version of an earlier work on Gravity-Aware Handheld Augmented Reality (AR) (Kurz and Benhimane, 2011 [1]), which investigates how different stages in handheld AR applications can benefit from knowing the direction of the gravity measured with inertial sensors. It presents approaches to improve the description and matching of feature points, detection and tracking of planar templates, and the visual quality of the rendering of virtual 3D objects by incorporating the gravity vector. In handheld AR, both the camera and the display are located in the user's hand and therefore can be freely moved. The pose of the camera is generally determined with respect to piecewise planar objects that have a static and known orientation with respect to gravity. In the presence of (close to) vertical surfaces, we show how Gravity-Aligned Feature Descriptors (GAFDs) improve the initialization of tracking algorithms relying on feature point descriptor-based approaches in terms of quality and performance. For (close to) horizontal surfaces, we propose to use the gravity vector to rectify the camera image and detect and describe features in the rectified image. The resulting Gravity-Rectified Feature Descriptors (GREFDs) provide an improved precision–recall characteristic and enable faster initialization, in particular under steep viewing angles. Gravity-rectified camera images also allow for real-time 6 DoF pose estimation using an edge-based object detection algorithm handling only 4 DoF similarity transforms. Finally, the rendering of virtual 3D objects can be made more realistic and plausible by taking into account the orientation of the gravitational force in addition to the relative pose between the handheld device and a real object. In comparison to the original paper, this work provides a more elaborate evaluation of the presented algorithms. We propose a method enabling the evaluation of inertial-sensor aided visual tracking methods without real inertial sensor data. By synthesizing gravity measurements from ground truth camera poses, we benchmark our algorithms on a large existing dataset. Based on this approach, we also develop and evaluate a gravity-adaptive approach that performs image-rectification only when beneficial.},

	abstract = {Close-range photogrammetry is based on the acquisition of imagery to make accurate measurements and, eventually, three-dimensional (3D) photo-realistic models. These models are a photogrammetric product per se. They are usually integrated into virtual reality scenarios where additional data such as sound, text or video can be introduced, leading to multimedia virtual environments. These environments allow users both to navigate and interact on different platforms such as desktop PCs, laptops and small hand-held devices (mobile phones or PDAs). In very recent years, a new technology derived from virtual reality has emerged: Augmented Reality (AR), which is based on mixing real and virtual environments to boost human interactions and real-life navigations. The synergy of AR and photogrammetry opens up new possibilities in the field of 3D data visualization, navigation and interaction far beyond the traditional static navigation and interaction in front of a computer screen. In this paper we introduce a low-cost outdoor mobile AR application to integrate buildings of different urban spaces. High-accuracy 3D photo-models derived from close-range photogrammetry are integrated in real (physical) urban worlds. The augmented environment that is presented herein requires for visualization a see-through video head mounted display (HMD), whereas user’s movement navigation is achieved in the real world with the help of an inertial navigation sensor. After introducing the basics of AR technology, the paper will deal with real-time orientation and tracking in combined physical and virtual city environments, merging close-range photogrammetry and AR. There are, however, some software and complex issues, which are discussed in the paper.},

Motivational factors of attention and satisfaction in an augmented-reality-based learning environment were better rated than those obtained in a slides-based learning environment. When the impact of the augmented reality system was analyzed in isolation, the attention and confidence factors were the best rated.

An interactive projection system is used in a theatrical performance, and the registration between the virtual scene (projected image) and the real objects (dancers) is realized through a video camera working in the near infrared waveband. An ultra-light wide-angle head-mounted display system is designed for an interactive exhibition item in a scientific museum, and a multi-user six-degree-of-freedom tracking system is developed for the indoor registration, which uses infrared markers projected on the ceiling and a camera fixed on top of each head-mounted display. A fixed-position viewing system is developed for the on-site digital reconstruction of a historical site, which provides visitors with the visualization of the original magnificent buildings on the natural field of the ruins. The azimuth and pitch of the viewing system are detected by two rotary encoders. A volumetric 3D display based on multi-angle projection is applied in a navigation system for endoscopic sinus surgery. A 3D digital scanner is employed to scan the skin on the patient's head for the alignment between the patient and the 3D model from his CT or MRI images. The registration of the surgical tool is also achieved by optical means through tracking cameras.},

However, relatively little is known about the potential of this technology to support teaching and learning with groups of young children in the classroom. Analysis of teacher–child dialogue in a comparative study between use of an AR virtual mirror interface and more traditional science teaching methods for 10-year-old children, revealed that the children using AR were less engaged than those using traditional resources. We suggest four design requirements that need to be considered if AR is to be successfully adopted into classroom practice. These requirements are: flexible content that teachers can adapt to the needs of their children, guided exploration so learning opportunities can be maximised, in a limited time, and attention to the needs of institutional and curricular requirements.},

It can provide better understanding about the contents and visual impressions for users. For AR books, this paper presents a markerless tracking method, which recognizes and tracks a large number of pages in real-time, even on PCs with low computation power. For fast recognition with respect to a large number of pages, we propose a generic randomized forest that is an extension of a randomized forest. In addition, we define the spatial locality of the subregions in an image to resolve the problem of a dropping recognition rate under a complex background. For tracking with minimal jittering, we also propose the adaptive keyframe-based tracking method, which automatically updates the current frame as a keyframe when it describes the page better than the existing one.

Fortunately, a few years later the Internet became the latest hot topic, leaving VR researchers free to go back to work. Almost a decade later, VR has gone from ldquo;almost there rdquo; to ldquo;barely there rdquo;. That's a big step! Perhaps by 2020 we will be ldquo;pretty well there rdquo;!

	abstract = {The support of realistic and flexible training simulations for military, law enforcement, emergency response, and other domains has been an important motivator for the development of augmented reality technology. An important vision for achieving this goal has been the creation of a versatile “stage” for physical, emotional, and cognitive training that combines virtual characters and environments with real world elements, such as furniture and props. This paper presents REFLCT, a mixed reality projection framework that couples a near-axis personal projector design with tracking and novel retroreflective props and surfaces. REFLCT provides multiple users with personalized, perspective-correct imagery that is uniquely composited for each user directly into and onto a surrounding environment, without any optics positioned in front of the user’s eyes or face. These characteristics facilitate team training experiences which allow users to easily interact with their teammates while wearing their standard issue gear. REFLCT can present virtual humans who can make deictic gestures and establish eye contact without the geometric ambiguity of a typical projection display. It can also display perspective-correct scenes that require a realistic approach for detecting and communicating potential threats between multiple users in disparate locations. In addition to training applications, this display system appears to be well matched with other user interface and application domains, such as asymmetric collaborative workspaces and personal information guides.},

	abstract = {Lab practices are an essential part of teaching in Engineering. However, traditional laboratory lessons developed in classroom labs (CL) must be adapted to teaching and learning strategies that go far beyond the common concept of e-learning, in the sense that completely virtualized distance education disconnects teachers and students from the real world, which can generate specific problems in laboratory classes. Current proposals of virtual labs (VL) and remote labs (RL) do not either cover new needs properly or contribute remarkable improvement to traditional labs—except that they favor distance training. Therefore, online teaching and learning in lab practices demand a further step beyond current VL and RL. This paper poses a new reality and new teaching/learning concepts in the field of lab practices in engineering. The developed augmented reality-based lab system (augmented remote lab, ARL) enables teachers and students to work remotely (Internet/intranet) in current CL, including virtual elements which interact with real ones. An educational experience was conducted to assess the developed ARL with the participation of a group of 10 teachers and another group of 20 students. Both groups have completed lab practices of the contents in the subjects Digital Systems and Robotics and Industrial Automation, which belong to the second year of the new degree in Electronic Engineering (adapted to the European Space for Higher Education). The labs were carried out by means of three different possibilities: CL, VL and ARL. After completion, both groups were asked to fill in some questionnaires aimed at measuring the improvement contributed by ARL relative to CL and VL. Except in some specific questions, the opinion of teachers and students was rather similar and positive regarding the use and possibilities of ARL. Although the results are still preliminary and need further study, seems to conclude that ARL remarkably improves the possibilities of current VL and RL. Furthermore, ARL can be concluded to allow further possibilities when used online than traditional laboratory lessons completed in CL.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on metallurgical characterisation of small cracks in pearlitic steels, using observations from both twin disc tests and rails removed from service, plus methods to determine three-dimensional (3D) aspects of such cracks. Tests to varying fractions of rolling contact fatigue (RCF) life have been assessed, based on twin disc tests where “average 100\% RCF life” has been defined by eddy current detection of cracks between 200 and 800 μm in depth. Contact surface features and microstructural alterations have been mapped against near-surface strain and compared with worn rail examinations. Initial crack growth along favourably aligned and strained, prior-austenite (PA) grain boundaries, particularly if the boundary contains pro-eutectoid (PE) ferrite, was found to be restricted or halted at the PA grain limit or where the boundary altered to be less-favourably aligned. For samples with up to 55\% RCF life, initial crack propagation length was still less than the average PA grain size. 3D aspects of this early growth and the deformed PA grain shapes were found to be linked to ratcheting flakes and flake cracks on test disc and rail contact surfaces. The results have shown how initial RCF crack propagation is very microstructurally influenced.},

The SUROS results supported the rail examinations with regard to surface RCF crack initiation and the RCF life and the part-life results showed the development of strain-partitioning.},

Head checks in particular are prevalent in curves and switches where flange contact at the gauge corner results in increased slip and decreased wheel–rail contact area. These surface-initiated cracks can lead to complete failure of the rail and potentially derailment. The focus of the EU Fifth Framework project InfraStar is on improving the durability and lifetime of the rail along stretches of track with narrow and moderate radius curve, high-traffic volumes and high axle loads by applying a surface coating to the railhead. The main goal of the project is to develop a railhead with an additional surface layer (the InfraStar two-material rail) which prevents RCF and reduces noise emissions in narrow-radius curved rail. Results are presented here from twin-disc laboratory testing and metallurgical analysis of specimens with the two selected new surface materials. The effects of lubrication, applied load and coating thickness were studied. An eddy current probe was used for crack detection. Both materials survived 200,000 cycles of water-lubricated twin-disc testing without crack formation, in contrast to UIC (260 grade) 900A base material which showed severe cracking after only 4000 cycles. Metallurgical investigations show excellent RCF resistance, although one coating developed cracks quickly during water-lubricated testing after 15,000 dry cycles, and bonding of the tested coatings (delamination occurred at the bonding interface of one coating during high-pressure tests).},

The tests were carried out on a twin-disc rolling-sliding contact simulation machine, using a maximum Hertzian contact pressure of 1500MPa with-1\% slip. The results showed that depending on the lubrication method, fatigue life could vary by up to an order of magnitude, but that in all cases it was longer than that of a water lubricated contact. It was concluded that under the conditions examined, dry methods of solid lubricant application can offer an effective means of lubrication without the possibility of enhancing rail RCF. Solid lubricants dispersed in liquid media give superior friction and wear reduction, but under the conditions tested lead to RCF.},

In just the first 2 years of the test, the total cost of grinding plus rail replacements was reduced by almost 40\%, while both the rail and track quality generally improved immensely. Although it may not be possible to reproduce such savings everywhere that RCF damage occurs, some lessons from the test are of general relevance. In particular, the development of even existing surface-initiated defects can effectively be halted by grinding and thereafter regularly reinstating, a profile which substantially removes loading from those cracks. In this test, the rate of metal removal by grinding was about 0.2 mm per 25 MGT. Methods were also developed for objectively monitoring the transverse and longitudinal profiles of the ground rail, and the depth of metal removed from the rail, i.e. the overall grinding “quality”. It would appear that the desired benefits of grinding can be obtained even if deviations of the transverse profile from a desired reference profile exceed specified limits over a significant fraction of the track.},

For this aim and to study the damage evolution at the wheel–rail interface, some twin disk rolling contact tests were carried out on a common wheel–rail material couple under a dry rolling–sliding condition typical of normal service. The tests were stopped at progressive cycles numbers for different couples of specimens, which were then cut and observed with optical and electron microscope in order to analyse the damage evolution in the zone near to the contact interface. A wear-rolling contact fatigue competition was observed with a progressive crack tip advance following a shear band cracking mechanism and crack tail removal due to wear. The numerical model allowed predicting the experimental strain profile along the depth as a function of contact cycles number, also demonstrating through the critical strain approach that in the analysed conditions wear was able to prevent deep crack formation.},

	abstract = {A ductile material subjected to repeated rolling contact can accumulate very high levels of shear strain near the surface. At some point the material loses its integrity and fails, and this failure is manifested in the form of wear (the material detaching from the surface and producing debris) or rolling contact fatigue (initiation of micro-cracks which may subsequently propagate and branch). Models of such contacts have been developed based on ductility exhaustion [Wear 245 (2000) 204; Int. J. Fatigue 22 (2000) 205]. For wear, the material is divided into layers and each layer accumulates shear strain dependent on the stress at that depth; once a layer has accumulated a critical shear strain it is deemed to have failed. In the work presented here, the models are improved by allowing variation with depth of material properties such as ductility and shear yield stress. This reflects the statistical variation of real materials arising from the microstructure. For rolling contact fatigue, ductility exhaustion has been taken to mean initiation of a micro-crack. However, this introduces ambiguity since ductility exhaustion is also the cause of wear of material from the surface. The suggestion, here, is that the dilemma can be resolved by considering a model which has a brick wall structure. Each material brick can lose integrity and thus fail. Dependent on whether the failed material is supported by adjacent bricks which are intact, the material may detach to produce wear debris. Bricks which fail but do not detach (either at the surface or below it) behave as micro-cracks; these can interact and grow, but can also be lost if the surface material is worn away later.},

	abstract = {Generally, rolling bearing fatigue is divided into subsurface and surface initiated types. Subsurface fatigue has long been considered as the major damaging mechanism in lubricated contact submitted to cyclic loading. The improvement in steel processing during the last 20 years resulted in high steel cleanliness and as a consequence in a large reduction of subsurface inclusion initiated damage. Nowadays one of the main causes of damage (the other one corresponding to starvation) is surface initiated failure due to lubricant contamination. In fact, hard particles present in lubricants with various origins (coming from either external or internal sources) can not be completely eliminated in most commercial applications. Passing through the contact, they produce dents on the raceways, which generate stress concentrations, leading to fatigue life reduction. This paper describes the experimental procedures developed at SNR Roulements to investigate the impact of dents on bearing performance and to study the damage mechanisms. The evaluation was conducted using 2 types of pre-damaging processes to simulate contaminant defects prior to fatigue test under clean lubrication:u - dent printing on the raceway of flat washers using a Rockwell hardness indenter, - performing well-controlled and repeatable level of natural dents on the raceways of bearings using a specific equipment to damage bearing surface. Three-dimensional surface topography was used to characterise dent morphology and to compare the influence of materials and heat treatments. The results show that the pre-denting method on roller bearings is efficient to reproduce surface morphology and damage encountered on the components of equipment under practical operating conditions but in a shorter time interval. They also reveal significant differences in the performance of various bearing products and materials. It demonstrates the ability of this process to quantify the damaging effect of contaminants on bearing life.},

The new criterion is intended for real-time assessment of subsurface RCF from measured wheel–rail contact forces. The only needed parameters in the new expression for the equivalent stress are the vertical force and the wheel and rail radii. Comparisons between the new and the original criterion are carried out and show good agreement for the studied cases of tangent track operations. By employing principles of vehicle dynamics the criterion is further extended to the case of operations in curves. Reasonable consistency was found for curve radii down to approximately 2000 m.},

	abstract = {Some important papers concerning the studies on rail wear and wheel/rail contact stresses are briefly reviewed. The present paper utilizes a numerical method to analyze the effect of railway vehicle curving on the wear and contact stresses of wheel/rail. The numerical method considers a combination of Kalker's non-Hertzian rolling contact theory, a material wear model and a vertical and lateral coupling dynamics model of the vehicle/track. In the analysis, the important factors influencing on the wear and the contact stresses are, respectively, the curving speed, the curved track super-elevation and the rail cant. Compared to the present model, some concerned models and results in the published papers are in detail discussed. Through the detailed numerical analysis, it is found that the difference between the normal loads of the left and right of the wheelset increases linearly with increasing the vehicle curving speed. The material wear volume per length along the rail running surface has a tendency to grow. However, the variation of the maximum normal contact stress has a large fluctuation as the curving speed increases. The increase of the maximum contact stress depends greatly on not only the normal load but also the profiles of the wheel/rail. Increasing the track super elevation efficiently lowers the normal load difference of the left and right of the front wheelset, and the contact stresses and the wear. The rail cant has a great influence on the low rail wear of the curve track. An increase in rail cant results in a great increase in the low rail wear of the curved track, and a decrease in the outside rail wear. These conclusions are very useful in the maintenance of the track.},

The vertical interaction between a train and the track is calculated as a time history for single or multiple wheels moving on periodically supported rails, using a wavenumber-based approach. This vertical dynamic wheel/rail force arises from the varying stiffness due to discrete supports (i.e. parametric excitation) and the roughness excitation on the railhead. The tangential contact problem between the wheel and rail is modelled using an unsteady two-dimensional approach and also using the three-dimensional contact model, FASTSIM. This enables the slip and stick regions in the contact patch to be identified from the input geometry and creepage between the wheel and rail. The long-term wear growth is then predicted by applying repeated passages of the vehicle wheelsets, as part of an iterative solution.},

Moreover, one elastic and one elastic–plastic finite element model of the contact are investigated with the commercial code ABAQUS. The finite element method is not limited by the half-space assumption or applicable to a linear-elastic material model only. The objective is to assess the four methods based on calculated contact pressure, contact patch size and penetration depth. Contact loads and contact locations, used as input data in the analysis, are taken from a vehicle dynamics simulation in the software GENSYS. The comparison is performed at a given cross-section in the crossing panel of a selected turnout design. To fulfil the requirements of the half-space assumption, the dimensions of the contact area must be small compared to the radii of curvature of the bodies in contact. On the selected cross-section, however, the half-space assumption does not hold since the smallest radius of rail curvature at the contact point is 13 mm, which is comparable to the largest semi-axis of the contact area. Nevertheless, it is found that the contact pressure distributions calculated using Hertz and CONTACT correlate well with those results obtained from the finite element method as long as no plastification of the material occurs.},

	abstract = {In the field of simulation of railroad vehicles, there are many numerical models to estimate the interaction forces between the wheel and rail. The main advantage of these models is that they can be used together with multi-body dynamics software to calculate the motion of a vehicle in real time. However, the result of these contact models is usually post-processed to estimate wear on the profiles and some hypotheses assumed by the contact models may be inadequate for wear analysis. This is the case when considering surface roughness, which is not introduced in the numerical models and makes wear prediction imprecise. In this work an experimental method based on the measurement of ultrasonic reflection is used to solve the contact problem, together with a FASTSIM (simplified theory of rolling contact) algorithm. This technique is suitable to deal with rough surfaces and gives a better approximation of the material behaviour. Wear is estimated by means of the energy dissipation approach (T·gamma). Two different contacts are investigated, using wheel and rail profiles coming from unused and worn specimens. In order to obtain realistic results, special care is taken when locating the specimens to reproduce the same contact that appears between the wheel and the rail in the track.},

In this paper, a 3D transient FE model is presented to solve both the normal and the tangential contact problems simultaneously for arbitrary geometry. The explicit time integration scheme employed renders it intrinsically suitable for transient analysis of high frequency dynamic processes. The model is first validated with Hertz theory and Kalker's computer program CONTACT for the normal solution and with CONTACT for the tangential solution, for the case of wheel tread–rail top contact. Subsequently, the influence of element size on solution accuracy is examined by comparing the results of different element sizes.

Stability investigations started with Boedecker (1887) and were continued by Carter (1916); however, they were not recognized at that time. Stability analysis was only considered to be an integrated step in vehicle design in about 1955 when stability problems started to occur in practice.

It is commonly assumed in such models that material is worn away in proportion to the frictional work done in the slip zone of each contact patch. Moreover, a constant coefficient of friction is usually assumed. However, it is known that the friction coefficient between sliding surfaces decreases as the velocity of sliding increases. This paper describes a technique for including more sophisticated friction laws in a model of wheel–rail rolling contact. A non-Hertzian model is used based on a variational method. The resulting tangential stress distribution and slip velocity in rolling contact are examined and compared with results calculated using a constant coefficient of friction. For conditions of rolling contact with partial slip a stick–slip oscillation is found to occur when a velocity-dependent friction law is used. The pattern of material removed along the rail in rolling contact is also investigated. For low creep values and for existing broadband roughness, the inclusion of velocity-dependent friction does not result in significantly different predictions of wear. For higher creep values, velocity-dependent friction results in an unstable force–friction relationship which could lead to high variable wear.},

	abstract = {The wheel–rail contact analysis plays a fundamental role in the multibody modelling of railway vehicles. A good contact model must provide an accurate description of the global and local contact phenomena (contact forces, position and shape of the contact patch, stresses and displacements) and a general handling of the multiple contact. The model has also to assure high numerical efficiency (in order to be implemented directly online within multibody models) and a good compatibility with commercial multibody software (Simpack Rail, Adams Rail). In this work, an elastic wheel–rail contact model that satisfies the previous specifics is presented. The model considers the wheel and the rail as elastic deformable bodies and requires the numerical solution of Navier's elasticity equation. The contact between wheel and rail has been described by means of suitable analytical contact conditions. Subsequently, the contact model has been inserted within the multibody model of a benchmark railway vehicle (the Manchester Wagon) in order to obtain a complete model of the wagon. The model has been implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment. Finally, numerical simulations of the vehicle dynamics have been carried out on many different railway tracks with the aim of evaluating the performances of the model. The results obtained with the proposed method have been compared with those obtained by means of a standard commercial software. The main purpose is to achieve a better integration between the differential modelling and the multibody modelling. This kind of integration is almost absent in the literature (especially in the railway field) due to the computational cost and to the memory storage needs. However, it is very important because only the differential modelling allows an accurate analysis of the contact problem (in terms of contact forces, position and shape of the contact patch, stresses and displacements) while the multibody modelling is currently the standard in the study of the railway dynamics.},

	abstract = {A time-domain method for the simulation of general three-dimensional dynamic interaction between a vehicle and a curved railway track, accounting for a prescribed relative wheel–rail displacement excitation in a wide frequency range (up to several hundred Hz), is presented. The simulation model is able to capture the low-frequency vehicle dynamics simultaneously due to curving and the high-frequency track dynamics due to the excitation by, for example, the short-pitch corrugation on the low rail. The adopted multibody dynamics formulation considers inertia forces, such as centrifugal and Coriolis forces, as well as the structural flexibility of vehicle and track components. To represent a wheel/rail surface irregularity, isoparametric two-dimensional elements able to describe generally curved surface shapes are used. The computational effort is reduced by including only one bogie in the vehicle model. The influence of the low-frequency vehicle dynamics of the remaining parts of the vehicle is considered by pre-calculated look-up tables of forces and moments acting in the secondary suspension. For a track model taken as rigid, good agreement is observed between the results calculated with the presented model and a commercial software. The features of the model are demonstrated by a number of numerical examples. The influence of the structural flexibility of the wheelset and track on wheel–rail contact forces is investigated. For a discrete rail irregularity excitation, it is shown that the longitudinal creep force is significantly influenced by the wheelset eigenmodes. The introduction of a velocity-dependent friction law is found to induce an oscillation in the tangential contact force on the low rail with a frequency corresponding to the first anti-symmetric torsional mode of the wheelset. Further, under the application of driving moments on the two wheelsets and excitation by a discrete irregularity on the high rail, the frequency content of the tangential contact forces on the low rail is significantly influenced by the P2 resonance as well as by several wheelset eigenmodes.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the modelling of yaw dampers and determining the influence of the modelling of this component on the results obtained when predicting the dynamic stability of a vehicle. The first part of the work analyses the influence of the yaw damper characteristics on railway dynamic stability. Following this, a physical model of the damper is developed which allows its performance to be reproduced accurately in the whole range of operating conditions the damper is envisaged to operate in. Once obtained, it was found that the computational cost of the model was relatively high. Therefore, a simplified model has been developed. The simplified model allows obtaining accurate results without excessively increasing the time required to perform the simulations. Analysing the results obtained with this model, it has been concluded that with respect to previous model based on conventional approaches, it improves the accuracy of dynamic calculation for the stability assessment. Also, it has been found that the accurate modelling of the yaw damper is critical when dealing with the vehicle's dynamic performance. In the last part of the paper, a special type of yaw damper was studied as well as its effect on the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle.},

	abstract = {Robust and efficient numerical methods are an essential prerequisite for the computer-based dynamical analysis of engineering systems. In vehicle system dynamics, the methods and software tools from multibody system dynamics provide the integration platform for the analysis, simulation and optimisation of the complex dynamical behaviour of vehicles and vehicle components and their interaction with hydraulic components, electronical devices and control structures. Based on the principles of classical mechanics, the modelling of vehicles and their components results in nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) of moderate dimension that describe the dynamical behaviour in the frequency range required and with a level of detail being characteristic of vehicle system dynamics. Most practical problems in this field may be transformed to generic problems of numerical mathematics like systems of nonlinear equations in the (quasi-)static analysis and explicit ODEs or DAEs with a typical semi-explicit structure in the dynamical analysis. This transformation to mathematical standard problems allows to use sophisticated, freely available numerical software that is based on well approved numerical methods like the Newton–Raphson iteration for nonlinear equations or Runge–Kutta and linear multistep methods for ODE/DAE time integration. Substantial speed-ups of these numerical standard methods may be achieved exploiting some specific structure of the mathematical models in vehicle system dynamics. In the present paper, we follow this framework and start with some modelling aspects being relevant from the numerical viewpoint. The focus of the paper is on numerical methods for static and dynamic problems, including software issues and a discussion which method fits best for which class of problems. Adaptive components in state-of-the-art numerical software like stepsize and order control in time integration are introduced and illustrated by a well-known benchmark problem from rail vehicle simulation. Over the last few decades, the complexity of high-end applications in vehicle system dynamics has frequently given a fresh impetus for substantial improvements of numerical methods and for the development of novel methods for new problem classes. In the present paper, we address three of these challenging problems of current interest that are today still beyond the mainstream of numerical mathematics: (i) modelling and simulation of contact problems in multibody dynamics, (ii) real-time capable numerical simulation techniques in vehicle system dynamics and (iii) modelling and time integration of multidisciplinary problems in system dynamics including co-simulation techniques.},

	abstract = {Previous work in the railway technology laboratory at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) focused on better capturing the dynamics of the friction wedge, modelled using three-dimensional rigid body dynamics with unilateral contact conditions. The current study extends the previous work to a half-bogie model treated as an application of multibody dynamics with unilateral contact to model the friction wedge interactions with the bolster and the sideframe. The half-bogie model was derived using MATLAB and functions as a three dimensional, dynamic, and multibody dynamics model comprised of four rigid bodies: a bolster, two friction wedges, and a sideframe assembly. This expanded model allows each wedge four degrees of freedom: vertical displacement, longitudinal displacement (between the bolster and sideframe), pitch (rotation around the lateral axis), and yaw (rotation around the vertical axis). The bolster and the sideframe are constrained to have only the vertical degree of freedom. The geometry of these bodies can be adjusted for various simulation scenarios. The bolster can be initialised with a pre-defined yaw (rotation around the vertical axis) and the sideframe may be initialised with a pre-defined pitch/toe (rotation around the lateral axis). The results of the multibody dynamics in half-bogie model simulation are shown in comparison with results from NUCARS®, an industry standard in train-modelling software, for similar inputs.},

	abstract = {Rail vehicle dynamic simulation has progressed a long way from its origins as a research tool. Modern multibody software packages are used as an essential part of the design process for new vehicles and for investigating service problems with existing vehicles. Increasingly, simulation is being used as part of the vehicle acceptance process in place of on-track testing. This state of the art paper for the 21st IAVSD Symposium in Stockholm in August 2009 surveys the current applications for rail vehicle dynamic modelling. The process of reducing a complex mechanical system to a mathematical representation is invariably subject to compromise and open to individual interpretation. The level of detail and choice of idealisation of suspension components will depend on the application, and in the real world it also depends on the availability of information about the system. This paper discusses appropriate modelling choices for different applications, and comments on best practice for the idealisation of suspension components, wheel/rail contact conditions and modelling inputs such as track geometry. The validation of simulation results is increasingly important, and this paper discusses recent trends in this area. Finally, the paper takes a brief look forward to future simulation issues.},

The basic singularities demonstrate themselves as double and multiple contact patches. The solutions of the contact problems have to be known practically in each step of the numerical integration of the differential equations of the model. The existing fast, approximate methods of solution to achieve this goal have been outlined. One way to do this is to replace a multi-point contact by a set of ellipses. The other methods are based on so-called virtual penetration. They allow calculating the non-elliptical, multiple contact patches and creep forces online, during integration of the model. This allows nearly real-time simulations. The methods are valid and applicable for so-called quasi-Hertzian cases, when the contact conditions do not deviate much from the assumptions of the Hertz theory. It is believed that it is worthwhile to use them in other cases too.},

Then, Hertz and Kalker's equations are used to establish the stresses at the level of a strip. These stresses expressions are used directly in a contact model discretized in strips and tabulated as a function of the lateral displacement between the wheel and the rail. The validation is made by comparison to the previous multi-Hertzian model of the VOCOLIN software.

	abstract = {In order to investigate the mechanism of derailment of high-speed trains due to an earthquake, a coupled vehicle/track dynamic model considering the earthquake effect is developed. The vehicle is modelled as a multi-body system of 35 degrees of freedom and the nonlinear suspension characteristic is considered. The slab track model considers the deformable rails, the discrete support of fasteners and the deformable slabs. Rails are assumed to be Timoshenko beams supported by the rail fasteners discretely, and the slabs are modelled with solid finite elements. The coupling of the vehicle and the track considers the track moving with respect to the vehicle running at a constant speed, and such a coupling model can simulate the effect of the periodical discrete rail supports on the vehicle/track interaction. The least-square curve fitting (LSCF) approach is introduced to integrate the originally recorded earthquake acceleration to acquire the velocity and displacement-time series of the earthquake. The system motion equations are solved by means of an explicit integration method in the time domain. The present paper analyses in detail the effect of the earthquake characteristic on dynamical behaviour of the vehicle and the track and the transient derailment criteria. The considered derailment criteria include the ratio of the wheel/rail lateral force to the vertical force, the wheel loading reduction, and the wheel/rail contact point traces on the wheel tread and the wheel rise with respect to the rail top, respectively. The present investigation includes the effect of lateral earthquake motion, vertical earthquake motion, operation speed, and their combined effect on the existing derailment criteria, respectively.},

To form a database for sampling, 120 wheel profiles from freight wagons in regular traffic have been measured and categorised with respect to wear. Among the investigated parameters, it is shown that equivalent conicity is the wheel profile parameter correlating best to damage in the S\&C panels. The influence of hollow worn wheels on damage is also investigated, and it is found that such wheel profiles display a different running behaviour at the crossing transition. Convergence properties for samples of runs generated by Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) are compared with the corresponding properties obtained by pure random sampling. It is concluded that the LHS-generated samples exhibit similar or smaller variance in damage compared with the randomly generated samples.},

In this paper, we present a newly developed three-dimensional nonlinear CoF model for the dry rail condition and test the CoF variation using this model with estimated dynamic parameters. The wheel–rail is modelled as a mass–spring–damper system to simulate the basic wheel–rail dynamics. Although relatively simple, this model is considered sufficient for the purpose of this study. Simulations are performed at a train speed of 20 m/s using rail roughness as an excitation source.

The final numerical procedure consists in finding the zeros of a nonlinear function in a single variable.

The range of contact parameters that occur for realistic vehicles and tracks are assessed using simulations with the Vampire vehicle system dynamics (VSD) package. This shows that larger values for the spin creepage occur rather frequently. Based on this, our approach is applied to typical cases for which railway VSD packages are used. The results show that particularly the USETAB approach but also FASTSIM give considerably better results than the linear theory, Vermeulen–Johnson, Shen–Hedrick–Elkins and Polach methods, when compared with the ‘complete theory’ of the CONTACT program.},

	abstract = {Higher train speeds and increased axle loads have led to larger forces acting on the railway wheels. Also, efforts are presently being made to straighten existing tracks, to design new tracks with larger curve radii and to optimize bogie designs. This evolution tends to shift the major cause of wheel rim damage from wear to fatigue due to the different physics of these two phenomena.
In contrast to the slow deterioration through wear, fatigue sometimes causes abrupt fractures where a part of the wheel tread breaks off. Such failures may cause damage to rails and sleepers and to train suspensions and bearings and, in rare cases, serious derailments. The failures may be very costly in terms of operational delays and human injuries. Thus, an understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms and a search for means of prevention of fatigue of railway wheels have become research subjects of great importance.
The approach in this thesis is twofold: (1) Fatigue failures of wheels in operation are investigated, causes of the failures are identified and possible countermeasures are discussed; (2) Fatigue initiation in railway wheels is studied theoretically including computer analyses of stress and strain and of the resulting impact on fatigue.
The above studies concern forged wheels and are supported by experimental tests. Rolling contact fatigue of railway wheels involves a number of complicating factors normally not encountered in the 'classical' fatigue analysis. Factors studied in some depth in this thesis include (1) multiaxial loading; (2) statistical effects; (3) material anisotropy; (4) material defects.
Among the concrete results obtained are parametric influences of load magnitudes and contact geometries on fatigue life, and also estimations of the influence of material defects and of the stochastic nature of the loads. A new material composition is proposed and tested. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)},

Tests were conducted under dry conditions and using water or oil as lubricants to study the influence of surface roughness on the adhesion coefficient. The results indicate that the adhesion coefficient can be reduced to as low as 0.02 for smooth surfaces lubricated with water. For rougher contact surfaces, the water-lubricated tests indicate a higher adhesion coefficient than do oil-lubricated ones, but also a clear dependence on water temperature. The oil-lubricated tests indicate a very slight dependence of the adhesion coefficient on variation in rolling speed, temperature, and surface roughness.},

This paper describes an experimental investigation, which mainly focused on the effects of surface roughness and water temperature on the adhesion between wheel and rail under wet conditions. The experiments were conducted by means of a twin-disc rolling contact machine using different water temperatures and various surface roughnesses. The maximum traction coefficient obtained by the experiments, which is called adhesion coefficient in railways, increased with an increase of the water temperature or the surface roughness, and the roughness orientation had an effect on the maximum traction coefficient. Based upon the experimental results, it can be a considerable method to improve the adhesion coefficient between wheel and rail under wet conditions by raising the water temperature or increasing the standard deviation of roughness height or controlling the roughness orientation.},

This article articulates the pedagogical potential of augmented reality simulations in environmental engineering education by immersing students in the roles of scientists conducting investigations. This design experiment examined if augmented reality simulation games can be used to help students understand science as a social practice, whereby inquiry is a process of balancing and managing resources, combining multiple data sources, and forming and revising hypotheses in situ. We provide 4 case studies of secondary environmental science students participating in the program. Positioning students in virtual investigations made apparent their beliefs about science and confronted simplistic beliefs about the nature of science. Playing the game in “real” space also triggered students' preexisting knowledge, suggesting that a powerful potential of augmented reality simulation games can be in their ability to connect academic content and practices with students' physical, lived worlds. The game structure provided students a narrative to think with, although students differed in their ability to create a coherent narrative of events. We argue that Environmental Detectives is 1 model for helping students understand the socially situated nature of scientific practice.

While the friction coefficient of reduced iron was a little larger than that of Fe2O3 at lower friction speed and load. As the friction speed and load increased, the friction coefficient gradually approached that of Fe2O3 due to the formation of Fe2O3 film along the sliding surface. .ALPHA.-FeOOH showed no lubricating ability.

	abstract = {Frictional behavior in dry or boundary-lubricated tribosystems is commonly time-dependent. Examples include phenomena like running-in, scuffing initiation, adhesive transfer, coating wear-through, and lubricant starvation. Fundamental models for the sliding friction coefficient usually focus either on determining a steady–state value or on predicting periodic behavior like stick-slip. They often neglect the details of long- and short-period frictional transients, some of which are quite repeatable. In addition to generating heat, frictional work is known to be dissipated in several ways, including roughness changes, wear particle generation, tribomaterial evolution, and microstructural alteration. Pairs of materials can display identical average friction coefficients but significantly different wear processes because frictional work is dissipated differently from one pair of materials to the next. The attributes of friction-versus-time behavior for combinations of metals, ceramics, and polymers can be comprised of stages whose understanding may require the development of piecewise friction models that include wear. This paper discusses past work on the subject, exemplifies embedding a simple wear model into a friction-versus-time model, and indicates how friction process diagrams can play a role.},

The complexity of wear and the large number of parameters affecting the outcome are the primary reasons for this situation. This paper summarizes the current understanding of wear modelling for metals. Several recent approaches such as wear mapping and wear transition diagrams have suggested some future possible directions for improvement. Some success has been achieved in describing severe wear of steels under unlubricated conditions using thermomechanical approaches. However, modelling of mild wear remains problematic, especially under lubricated conditions. In mild wear, asperity contact events dominate the wear processes. A single asperity collision simulation apparatus has been used to study asperity-asperity contact phenomena. Shear strain and strain accumulation were found to be the dominant underlying causes for wear. It is proposed that future research in wear prediction for metals incorporate the following aspects: wear mapping, temperature, shear strain response, boundary lubricating film strength, and surface roughness.},

	abstract = {A major objective in the development of new rail materials is improving their wear performance. Historically, the main method to accomplish this goal was to manufacture rail steels with higher hardness. However, there is a limit to the hardness that can be achieved with conventional pearlitic rail steels. As a result, there has been an increased focus on improving rail steel hardness with alternative microstructures, such as bainitic microstructure, which indeed can achieve higher hardness than conventional pearlitic rail steels. Unexpectedly, the newly developed harder bainitic rails exhibited worst wear performance than conventional pearlitic rails when tested in actual rail track trials. In the first part of this paper, we obtained bainitic and pearlitic rail steel samples that were tested in an actual wheel/rail track. Using these samples, detailed micro-Vickers and Rockwell C hardness measurements at different length scales were conducted to investigate the cause of their wear behavior, namely the fact that softer pearlitic steels exhibited better wear performance than the harder bainitic steels. It was found that the initially softer pearlitic rail steel was work hardened more than the initially harder bainitic rail steel as in-service stresses accumulated on the rails, and thus the better wear performance. The second part of the paper describes pure sliding laboratory experiments that were performed using both pearlitic and bainitic samples. These simpler laboratory experiments, confirmed that indeed pearlitic steel work hardens more with tribological contact testing and exhibits less wear compared to J6 bainitic steel, supporting the rail track findings. It is therefore important to consider the in-service work microhardening behavior of rail steels as the initial hardness cannot reliably predict rail wear and rail life.},

The Transportation Technology Center Incorporated (TTCI), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Association of American Railroads, Pueblo, Colorado, continuously conducts full scale rail performance tests, which represent a multi-million-dollar investment and take many years to complete.

This research paper addresses the development of a simple laboratory technique that can be used as a screening method for rail performance. This method is cost effective and rapid and is intended to be used prior to the full-scale test. The laboratory test consists on a ball-on-disk, pure-sliding experiment. In the present research were used only premium rails from various manufacturers for both, the ball-on-disk and full scale test and the results of both tests are provided in the present paper. The full-scale rail performance test is conducted by TTCI at the Facility for Accelerated Servicing Testing (FAST), which consists of a 4.4\&\#xa0;km of railroad heavy haul tracks. The results of both, ball-on-disk and full-scale tests, presented in this paper correspond to the two latest generations of premium (pearlitic) rails and one bainitic rail. Such rails were produced by six rail manufacturers. Both, FAST and ball-on-disk tests showed that under high contact pressures (heavy haul conditions) the bainitic rail does not perform well as the pearlitic rails. Due to the significant differences, in particular dynamic forces, among the ball-on-disk and full-scale tests there is no direct relationship among both tests. Nonetheless, the ball-on-disk test can be used to distinguish wear performance among the two generations of rails tested for the present research; therefore, the ball-on-disk test can be used as a screening method prior to the full scale test.},

This in turn allows better understanding of the rail characteristics that require improvements and is used to extend rail's life. Recent research has focused on methods to streamline the developments of prototype rail steels using laboratory tribotests. The results of the tribotests indicate that sliding ball-on-disk experiments can be used to qualitatively approximate rail wear and using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) it is possible to observe different tribological behaviour between rails (mild to severe wear). For instance, SEM micrograph analysis can lead to the determination of the propensity of rail crack formation under pure sliding and the detrimental effects of pro-eutectoid cementite and hard inclusions (e.g., Al2O3) on crack formation and delamination.},

Tests were carried out using a twin disk machine with the specimen cut from rail and wheel sections. The disk surfaces were artificially indented and run under conditions of water lubrication, dry, oil lubrication, and solid particulate contamination. Analysis of the failures was by surface microscopy and sections taken in the rolling direction.

Under conditions of oil lubrication the surface defects act as initiators of fatigue cracks. The dent is reduced in size during the first few revolutions and then reaches a constant size. A crack forms at the trailing edge of the original indentation and propagates to form a spall.

With water lubrication plastic flow causes the dent to decreases in size throughout the test. Contact fatigue occurs all over the surface with no particular preference to the region of the indentation. Unlubricated, dry disks did not suffer from fatigue cracking but did wear rapidly. Indentations are worn out of the surface and do not promote failure.

When the disk pair were contaminated with granite ballast dust the surface were roughened rapidly. Surface denting was minor and did not lead to conventional fatigue cracking. The ballast rapidly. Surface denting was minor and did not lead to conventional fatigue cracking. The ballast however did cause severe surface flow that was found to reduce the time to crack initiation in subsequent clean water lubricated cycles.},

A preliminary study into the implications of the change in lubrication method for rail rolling contact fatigue (RCF) was carried out. The tests were carried out on a twin-disc rolling-sliding contact simulation machine, using a maximum Hertzian contact pressure of 1500MPa with-1\% slip. The results showed that depending on the lubrication method, fatigue life could vary by up to an order of magnitude, but that in all cases it was longer than that of a water lubricated contact. It was concluded that under the conditions examined, dry methods of solid lubricant application can offer an effective means of lubrication without the possibility of enhancing rail RCF. Solid lubricants dispersed in liquid media give superior friction and wear reduction, but under the conditions tested lead to RCF.},

	abstract = {Sanding is used in train operation to improve adhesion at the wheel/rail interface in both braking and traction. An experimental study has been carried out to determine the effect of sanding on the wear of wheel and rail materials. Static tests were performed using actual wheel and rail sections, and dynamic tests were carried out on a twin disc machine, where wheel and rail steel discs are loaded together and driven under controlled conditions of rolling and sliding. Sand was fed into the disc contact through a standard compressed air sanding valve.

After static crushing of sand both wheel and rail surfaces showed evidence of severe damage and indentations up to 100μm deep had been formed.

It was found during the dynamic tests that on the application of sand, wear rates of wheel and rail discs were increased by factors of between 2 and 10. The wheel steel wear rates showed the larges increases. Wear in wet condition was higher than dry because the wet discs entrained a larger amount of sand through the contact that otherwise bounced off when the discs were run dry.

For tests run with sand, severe plastic flow resulted as well as high material loss and some surface corrugation. Rail discs exhibited abrasive score marks. This was because the softer wheel material was trapping most of the sand particles that then abraded the rail material. The wheel disc showed evidence of surface cracking and material spallation caused by a fracture process.

With no sand in the contact, plastic deformation again occurred as well as surface corrugation on the rail disc. No abrasive wear marks could be seen on the rail disc surface, but small pits usually associated with ratchetting wear were evident. The wheel disc exhibited evidence of delamination wear. The outer layer of material was seen to be “peeling” away from the surface of the disc. There was no indication of the low cycle fatigue process observed when passing sand through the disc contact.},

Twin disc testing of rail and wheel materials was carried out to generate wear coefficients for use in the model.

The modelling code is interfaced with ADAMS/Rail, which produces multi-body dynamics simulations of a railway wheelset and contact conditions at the wheel/rail interface. Simplified theory of rolling contact is used to discretise the contact patches produced by ADAMS/Rail and calculate local traction and slip.

It mainly relies on asymmetrical railhead profiles which are only used in curves and can be applied to existing track by means of an automised grinding operation. In contrast to merely corrective remedies such as wear resistant materials or lubrication, this measure attacks the roots of excessive wear and damage without however involving expensive design changes to the vehicles. Also, it does not impair running stability on straight track or traction and braking performance, because the changes only affect the rails in curves. Though occasionally applied in heavy rail systems previously, the introduction of these changes to a specific light rail system needs to be carefully investigated and coordinated with an optimisation of the wheel profiles. It is for this reason that the computational simulations and extensive field tests reported in this paper were carried out prior to these changes being generally introduced in the Stuttgart light rail system.},

The friction coefficient is one of the most relevant parameters for the rolling contact of railway wheels and rails. A model of dry friction is established based on the method of movable cellular automata (MCA). The influence of pressure and sliding velocity has been investigated by means of a large number of numerical simulations. A general qualitative conclusion is the fact that dynamic processes of plastic deformation and fracture at the nanolevel are of great importance. Within this model, the contact temperature can also be considered by its influence on the strength of materials. The new friction law is applied to the calculation of stresses, deformations and tractive forces in wheel/rail contact with rough surfaces.

In this work innovative methods to evaluate the position of contact points are presented. The aim is to develop a method which can be implemented on-line, assuring a calculation time consistent with real-time calculations of multibody dynamics. At the same time it has to be very accurate, to properly predict the local forces at contact in order to describe even the wear of contact surfaces.

In this work the authors present two different approaches to find stationary points during a multibody simulation. In the former the conditions to define a local minima are wrote in an analytical way. This makes possible to combine the conditions in order to reduce the analytic problem's dimension and then to solve numerically the problem with a low computational burden. The latter approach calculates the location of local minima using a method based on neural networks.

The paper will cover the details of the proposed methods and the performances, in terms of computation time and accuracy, will be compared with those of the conventional algorithms used by commercial softwares, showing their reliability and low computational burden. Moreover, an implementation of the proposed models in a multibody simulator will be presented, in order to show their suitability for this application.},

Similar articles have been published in two journals: one dealing specifically with this subject in Fatigue Fract. Eng. Mater. Struct. while the other, in this special issue of Wear, describes a more general experimental approach. Some parts of this article, which describe in details the reality of the wheel–rail contact, have been used in the synthesising article: Y. Berthier, S. Descartes, M. Busquet, E. Niccolini, C. Desrayaud, L. Baillet, M.C. Baietto-Dubourg, The role and effects of the third body in the wheel–rail interaction, Fatigue Fract. Eng. Mater.

This paper focuses on the presence of the third body, a solid interfacial layer, in the wheel–rail contact. A phenomenological analysis is carried out as thoroughly as possible of the real tribological behaviour of this contact. To improve the understanding of the wheel–rail contact reality and the reconstitution of contact dynamics, this paper is presented a synthesis of different studies coming from: analysis of specimens taken out periodically from rails and wheels in service, and thus under real contact conditions, test laboratories, allowing us to impose rolling–sliding conditions with very high precision. The results show the presence of natural third body ranging in thickness from a few micrometers to several dozen micrometers on the rail and wheel. Initially composed of particles stemming from wheels and rails, it flows into the contact to accommodate the sliding between wheel and rail while absorbing and digesting solid and fluid contaminants. Up to now, the third body is a means of tracing local conditions in the wheel–rail contact, in order to pass through the difficulties of in situ instrumentation. From all these studies and results, a better understanding of the role of the third body and its influence on friction is reached. It also controls the rail's lifetime, the lubrication as well as the wheel–rail adherence via its “degradation and/or reformation” mechanisms.},

	abstract = {In the field of simulation of railroad vehicles, there are many numerical models to estimate the interaction forces between the wheel and rail. The main advantage of these models is that they can be used together with multi-body dynamics software to calculate the motion of a vehicle in real time. However, the result of these contact models is usually post-processed to estimate wear on the profiles and some hypotheses assumed by the contact models may be inadequate for wear analysis. This is the case when considering surface roughness, which is not introduced in the numerical models and makes wear prediction imprecise. In this work an experimental method based on the measurement of ultrasonic reflection is used to solve the contact problem, together with a FASTSIM (simplified theory of rolling contact) algorithm. This technique is suitable to deal with rough surfaces and gives a better approximation of the material behaviour. Wear is estimated by means of the energy dissipation approach (T·gamma). Two different contacts are investigated, using wheel and rail profiles coming from unused and worn specimens. In order to obtain realistic results, special care is taken when locating the specimens to reproduce the same contact that appears between the wheel and the rail in the track.},

While most available wheel/rail interaction models include the contact filter effect by roughness pre-processing, a time-domain model is presented in this paper that includes the contact filter effect dynamically by an appropriate two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) non-Hertzian contact model. The 2D contact model is based on a Winkler bedding, while wheel and rail are locally approximated by elastic half-spaces in the 3D contact model. The wheel/rail interaction model is applied to evaluate the contact filter effect for different sets of roughness data measured in several parallel lines. It is found that the 3D contact model gives, as a general tendency, a contact force level several dB lower than the 2D model. The differences increase with a decrease in correlation between the roughness on parallel lines and vary significantly with the choice of roughness line in the 2D model.},

	abstract = {At present, optimizing control of maximum wheel-rail adhesion, from the anti-skidding systems piloting the sliding and the rolling speeds of locomotives, is done on the basis of the wheel-rail contact models available in the literature.

Improved accuracy of power train control has highlighted the limits of this optimization technique since the contact conditions of the models, i.e. the stick/slip zones, do not take into account the physical phenomena involved, although they are hardly known.

To attenuate this difficulty, the recent works presented in this paper, allow describing the tribological reality of a wheel-rail contact, i.e. the progression of the stick/slip zones. This reality is achieved thanks to monitoring the changes in the the characteristics of the third body present between wheel and rail.

The results of tests under initial condition show that there is a correlation between the progressions of the third body flows and that of the adhesion for the various phases of the adhesion-sliding curve. Therefore activation of the intermal flow of third body is in fact the physical manifestation of the theoretical condition of stick. On the other hand, the activation of the internal source and recirculation flows of the third body are the physical manifestation of the theoretical condition of slip. This tribological reality therefore allows us to update the theoretical stick/slip conditions and by consequence, anti-skidding systems.},

	abstract = {The rheological behaviour of interfacial layers forming a third body in rolling-sliding contact (such as locomotive wheel and rail) and consisting of wear debris and contaminants, is an important factor affecting rolling-sliding contact traction characteristics. The shear stress properties of individual components of the contaminant layer, such as oxidized wear debris, sand, clay and molybdenum disulfide, were measured for different slip distances using a specially designed rheology apparatus. Based on experimental results, the following elastic-plastic rheological model for compressed layers is suggested: τ=Gγ when τ⪇τcτ=τc+k(γ−γ) when τ\&gt;τc

This model establishes a relationship between three rheological parameters: the shear moduli of elasticity (G) and plasticity (k) and the critical shear stress (τc). Based on this relationship, a frictional model for rolling-sliding contacts separated by an interfacial layer is presented in this paper. It shows that the friction is affected by the third-body rheology, slip distance and the load, with the shear stress versus slip distance relationship of the interfacial layer exhibiting the dominant influence.},

	abstract = {Results from the European 5th frame research project ‘INFRA-STAR’ are presented. The goal of the project is to prevent rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and to reduce squeal noise in curves by applying an additional surface layer material on the top of the railhead, resulting in a two-material rail. In INFRA-STAR, a dynamic train–track interaction model is used to provide the contact forces. Wheel-rail profiles, wheel-rail friction, vehicle data, track data and operating conditions are included to calculate the wheel-rail contact forces and spin moments, contact positions and load distributions in the contact patch. The contact pressure, friction coefficient, coating thickness, material properties of the coating and the rail material are used in finite element calculations and shakedown theory to calculate shakedown limits, which are then used to predict the RCF performance of the system. The paper details the work on theoretical modelling, twin disc testing, metallurgical research and field testing completed to date (August 2002, the project just passed midterm). The development of the surface layer application methods that are used, and the further objectives of the INFRA-STAR project, are discussed.},

However, material in a railway rail is loaded not once but many times and the load limit below which the material remains elastic in the steady state is known as the elastic shakedown limit. This limit is higher than the elastic limit, and is the basis of tribological design. Such limits are known for solids which have hardness unvarying with depth. However, techniques of heat treatment or coating lead to a variation in hardness with depth for which the effect on the shakedown limit has only recently been established. In the present work the influence of strain hardening on the shakedown limit of a pearlitic rail steel has been analysed. The data used were taken from an experimental study by Tyfour et al. (1) in which wheel-rail contact was simulated by rolling-sliding line contact. The results indicate that the load bearing capacity increases to about four times that without strain hardening in line contact, and even more in point contact.},

Techniques developed over recent years have progressively refined the interlamellar spacing to produce harder, more wear-resistant pearlitic steels. This study aims to explain the mechanisms for the wear performance by observing how the microstructure adapts to the wear loading.

Four pearlitic rail steels, with similar chemical compositions but with different interlamellar spacings, have been examined. Wear tests have been performed under both pure sliding and rolling-sliding conditions, the latter designed to simulate track conditions. The worn surfaces and the plastically deformed subsurface regions have been examined by optical metallography and scanning electron microscopy.

It was observed that the plastic deformation produced considerable fracturing and realignment of the hard cementite lamellae. The softer ferrite matrix was severely deformed, allowing a reduction in the interlamellar spacing on approaching the worn surface. The effect of these realignments on the surface was to present an increased area fraction of hard cementite lamellae on planes parallel to the surface. Thinner cementite lamellae, associated with low interlamellar spacings, were easier to bend before fracturing. It is believed that shear ductility plays an important role in the period of time that any particular volume of material remains at the surface before becoming a loose particle.},

	abstract = {For several years excessive wheel flange wear has been a serious problem on certain lines of the Santander FEVE rail urban transit and regional passenger-freight system. An onboard liquid lubrication system applied at the driving wheels of the electrical units was in use. Average flange thickness wear was excessive when compared with existing data from similar railways. The excessive flange wear was believed to be caused by inefficiencies in the lubrication system: (a) the viscosity of the lubricant was sensitive to climatic conditions; (b) the lubricant tended to migrate from the area of application to the top running surface of the rail.

At the beginning of 1991 a new lubrication system developed by Century Oils using a solid lubricant was applied on a selected unit, with the objectives (a) to avoid the problem of contamination of the top of the rail, (b) to achieve and maintain steady state lubrication levels, in any weather, (c) to be effective only where it was desired, and (d) as a consequence to reduce flange friction wear and maintenance costs.

The trials were conducted by FEVE and VIESA starting in January and continuing through June of 1991. The improvements achieved using the Century Oil Centrac solid lubrication have been so evident that other units have been equipped with the new system.},

However, sometimes a transformation from a mild to a severe state may occur which will lead to a rise in friction and a catastrophic increase in wear. This severe situation is often known as scoring, galling, scuffing or seizure depending on the appearance of the surfaces. In this study the influence of surface roughness and oil viscosity on the transition from the mild to the severe sliding condition is studied. It is found that the transition in lubricated sliding steel contacts running under mixed conditions is strongly dependent on surface roughness. The loading capability of a sliding contact may be increased considerably by smoothing the surface. Even marginal flattening of the asperities may give considerable effects. However, single scratches may change the situation, since a scratch on a smooth surface will increase the risk for transition to a local seizure or scoring sometimes ending in a total seizure.},

	abstract = {The authors have recently assessed the feasibility of applying an ultrasonic technique for investigating contact problems between the wheel and rail. In particular, the size and shape of the contact area have been determined, obtaining good agreement between the experimental data and Hertz’s theory. Real contact area (RCA) has also been evaluated and experimental results have demonstrated that under normal loads (i.e. for contact pressures of 600–800\&\#xa0;MPa), this area is just a small fraction of the nominal one, its value depending strongly on initial roughness of the surfaces in contact.

In this paper, the ultrasonic method has been used to estimate the distribution of contact pressure in a real wheel–rail system. To achieve this, a preliminary series of tests has been conducted on a simple sphere–plate contact in order to analyse ultrasonic reflection from the interface. A finite element model (FEM) has also been developed to calculate pressure distribution over the whole contact area. In this way, an empirical relationship between contact pressure and ultrasonic reflection has been established, useful for calibrating the experimental set-up.

Ultrasonic wave reflection was then analysed for a wheel–rail system and the reflection coefficient matrices obtained from the scans for each load applied were converted into contact pressure matrices by means of the calibration curve.

The results agree substantially with the Hertz’s theory, though significant differences have been observed in terms of regularity of the pressure ellipsoid shape. Nonetheless, the ultrasonic method seems to confirm its features of simplicity and reliability that render it potentially useful for investigating the wheel–rail contact parameters.},

A spring modelwas used to determine maps of contact stiffness from wheel/rail contact ultrasonic reflection data. A calibration procedure was then used to determine the pressure. Measured contact pressure contours are compared with those predicted by various contact theories.},

Friction and wear tests were carried out at sliding speeds from 30 to 60\&\#xa0;m/s and at contact pressure ranging from 0.33 to 1.33\&\#xa0;MPa. In order to change the heat-transfer capability of Ti6Al4V pin, one group of pins were Ti6Al4V alloys, another group of pins made of two parts were Ti6Al4V alloy and copper. The dynamic sliding temperatures of Ti6Al4V alloys were measured using thermocouples. Morphology and composition of the surface and subsurface for Ti6Al4V alloy were examined by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The tests results were used for investigation of the relationship between sliding interface temperature, microstructure, friction coefficient, wear rate and heat-transfer capability. Finally, it is observed that heat-transfer capability enhancement is of great benefit to reducing the sliding interface temperature for Ti6Al4V alloy. Furthermore, advance in heat-transfer capability is favorable for increase in friction coefficient of Ti6Al4V/GCr15 pairs and in resistance to wear of Ti6Al4V. And moreover, the weight of GCr15 disc was changed from increase to loss. This indicates that transition of wear mechanism exists.},

Surface observations have shown that the evolution of the frictional response involves localized asperity deformation and fracture, surface plowing with formation of small debris, adhesive wear with formation of larger surface debris, and transfer between titanium and the steel counterpart. Surfaces of the metastable-β alloys exhibited greater surface deformation and transfer than did Ti–6Al–4V pins, plowing being representative of surface damage for the two-phase α+β. The amount of titanium transfer increased with increasing contact stress, transfer being always greater for the metastable-β alloys. Additionally wear debris collected at the end of the tests were a mixture of titanium and steel alloy constituents. The extensive plastic deformation, plowing and galling, transfer, and mechanical alloying observed all indicate that the dynamic friction behavior of titanium alloys is controlled by their surface deformation behavior and transfer characteristics.},

Among the most recent surface modification techniques, plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) has been successfully applied to titanium alloys. The aim of the present study was to investigate the friction and wear behaviour of a PEO coating on the Ti6Al4V alloy. The tribological behaviour of the PEO treated Ti alloy was compared with that of thin PVD coatings, such as TiN, (Ti,Al)N and CrN/NbN superlattice deposited on the same substrate. The tests were carried out under dry sliding conditions (slider-on-cylinder geometry) against a plasma-spray Al2O3–TiO2 coated steel. TiN gave the best tribological performance among the PVD coatings, up to 20\&\#xa0;N.

	abstract = {The potential of cryogenic effect on frictional behaviour of newly developed titanium alloy Ti–5Al–4V–0.6Mo–0.4Fe (Ti54) sliding against tungsten carbide was investigated and compared with conventional titanium alloy Ti6Al4V (Ti64). In this study, four models were developed to describe the interrelationship between the friction coefficient (response) and independent variables such as speed, load, and sliding distance (time). These variables were investigated using the design of experiments and utilization of the response surface methodology (RSM). By using this method, it was possible to study the effect of main and mixed (interaction) independent variables on the friction coefficient (COF) of both titanium alloys.

Under cryogenic condition, the friction coefficient of both Ti64 and Ti54 behaved differently, i.e. an increase in the case of Ti64 and decrease in the case of Ti54. For Ti64, at higher levels of load and speed, sliding in cryogenic conditions produces relatively higher friction coefficients compared to those obtained in dry air conditions. On contrary, introduction of cryogenic fluid reduces the friction coefficients of Ti54 at all tested conditions of load, speed, and time.

The established models demonstrated that the mixed effect of load/speed, time/speed, and load/time consistently decrease the COF of Ti54. However this was not the case for Ti64 whereas the COF increased up to 20\% when the Ti64 was tested at higher levels of load and sliding time. Furthermore, the models indicated that interaction of loads and speeds was more effective for both Ti-alloy and have the most substantial influence on the friction. In addition, COF for both alloys behaved linearly with the speed but nonlinearly with the load.},

It is shown that at cryogenic temperatures the friction coefficients of pairs of two types of DLC coatings obtained by vacuum-arc deposition of filtered high-speed carbon plasma fluxes depend to a great deal on the mechanical properties of the coatings defined by predominant sp2 or sp3 hybridization of valence electrons. A friction coefficient of 0.76 was observed for friction pairs of superhard (90 GPa) DLC coatings having properties similar to those of diamond. For “softer” DLC coatings of 40 GPa and properties similar to those of graphite the friction coefficient shows lower values (0.24–0.48) dependent on normal load and counterbody material. The DLC coatings obtained by the filtered arc technology exhibit good wear resistance and have strong adhesion to the substrate under friction in liquid nitrogen. With a normal load of 10 N under cryogenic temperature a low wear rate (of the order of 7.2×10−4 nm/cycle) was found for superhard DLC coatings. The friction coefficient of pairs with hard ZrN and superhard DLC coatings on steel discs was revealed to be linearly dependent on the counterbody material hardness between 20 and 100 GPa. The hardness of the pin was varied by means of depositing TiN or DLC coatings and also by using high-hardness compounds (boron nitride and synthetic diamond). Proceeding this way can be promising since it offers the possibility of creating low-temperature junctions of required friction properties.},

PTFE and PTFE composites have shown favorable tribological performance as solid lubricants. This study evaluates the effect of temperature on the friction coefficient of neat PTFE, a PTFE/PEEK composite and an expanded PTFE (ePTFE)/epoxy coating. These experiments evaluate friction coefficient over a temperature span which, to the investigators’ knowledge, has not been previously examined. Results show a monotonic increase in friction coefficient as sample surface temperature was decreased from 317 to 173 K for all three samples. The frictional performance of these and other published solid lubricant polymers was modeled using an adjusted Arrhenius equation, which correlates the coefficient of friction of the polymer materials to their viscoelastic behavior. A model fit of all the polymer data from 173 to 450 K gives an activation energy of 3.7 kJ/mol. This value suggests that breaking of van der Waals bonds is the likely mechanism responsible for the frictional behavior over this temperature range.},

	abstract = {Automotive braking systems normally employ brake discs made of steel or grey cast iron, which are then paired with composite organic brake pads. These types of materials are suitable for use in braking systems with moderate loads, but car manufacturers are tending to design increasing numbers of prestige and sports-class vehicles that need braking systems with more braking power. As a result, new materials are being introduced into braking systems, for example, carbon–ceramic C/CSiC composites. However, much higher temperatures are generated at these ceramic surfaces, which imply some new requirements for the contact materials and the testing equipment. In this paper, we present a new tester dedicated for evaluating the tribological performance of ceramic-based composites for brake applications that uses reduced-scale samples with conformal contacts. The size of the samples was determined on the basis of the vehicle's speed (0–300\&\#xa0;km/h), the contact pressure (0.1–10\&\#xa0;MPa), the temperature (20–900\&\#xa0;°C) and the geometrical proportions of full-scale braking systems. Special care was taken over the testing-head design in order to ensure control and measurement of the high temperatures that are generated at the contact. The simplicity and small size of the samples made it relatively easy to perform the various surface analyses. The theoretical background, the mechanical design and the controls of the testing device are presented. The functionality and reliability of the new device and the testing procedures were verified by using two brake-material combinations: conventional grey cast iron against a metal–matrix composite and a carbon–ceramic composite against a metal–matrix composite. The results confirmed our assumptions about the very high temperatures that are generated at the ceramic contacts and the necessity for well-controlled contact conditions. In addition, these first results suggest there are some beneficial frictional properties with a new material combination using in-house-developed MMC pads and C/CSiC discs.},

	abstract = {Despite the advantages of modern designs of railway vehicles and their running gear and possibilities of introducing active wheelset steering control systems, many railroads and tram companies still use large numbers of old fashion vehicles. Dynamic performance, safety and maintenance costs strongly depend on the wheelset dynamics and, particularly, on the design of wheel and rail profiles. The present paper presents a design procedure for a wheel profile based on geometrical wheel/rail (w/r) contact characteristics, which uses a numerical optimization technique. The procedure has been developed by the Railway Engineering Group at Delft University of Technology. The formulated optimality criteria, which use requirements on railway track and wheelset, are related to stability of wheelset, cost efficiency of design and minimum wear of wheels and rails. The shape of a wheel profile has been varied during optimization. A new wheel profile is obtained for given target rolling radii difference (RRD) function and rail profile. Measurements of new and worn wheel and rail profiles have been used to define the target RRD curve. Finally, in order to check the w/r wear and safety requirements, dynamic simulations of a vehicle with obtained wheel profile have been performed using ADAMS/Rail software package. The proposed procedure has been applied to the design of a wheel profile for trams. Numerical results are presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {Infrastructure systems are central to quality of life and economic competitiveness in nations worldwide, but daunting challenges stand in the way of providing systems capable of delivering needed infrastructure services. In the United States, the transportation system, which is widely considered to be the nation's largest infrastructure system, provides a case study of the complex investment, design, and operations-related problems of infrastructure service provision. An effective and efficient research and development (R\&D) system is needed to support the search for solutions to these problems; the nation is served by a large and well-developed transportation R\&D system, but given the magnitude of outstanding needs for new technologies, systems, and policies and the persistence of resource shortfalls, it is appropriate to re-examine all aspects of the transportation R\&D enterprise in search of strategies for improving its performance. This thesis identifies and analyzes factors that influence the performance of the transportation R\&D system and how it can respond to emerging infrastructure challenges. It first discusses categories and characteristics of infrastructure and seeks to place analysis of infrastructure systems, like the transportation system, in a broader socio-economic and environmental context. The thesis then outlines the basic composition of the transportation research and development system and explores the policy environment and critical issues that influence both transportation R\&D challenges and the behavior of the system in response to those challenges. Data on transportation R\&D expenditures, including longitudinal data for the sector as well as limited cross-sectoral comparisons to place it in context, is presented. Finally, examination of issues (like coordination and integration) related to the structure of the R\&D system, is included to frame the prior analysis of expenditures within a broader range of potential strategies for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the transportation R\&D system.},

The exchange of cast iron brake blocks by composite ones is a well-known low-cost measure to reduce pass-by noise. The Swiss Agency for the Environment (BUWAL) commissioned a measurement campaign in the year 2003 to define the noise limit, test conditions and maintenance procedures for retrofitted freight wagons.

The test was set up in order to allow the control, or at least the knowledge of all relevant parameters concerning track, vehicles, test and boundary conditions. A track section was reconstructed. The test train was arranged with one reference group of wagons with cast iron brake blocks and several groups of wagons with composite brake blocks and different characteristics. As all wagon groups were operated together in one test train, boundary conditions and test parameters were identical for all wagons.

The noise reduction achieved relative to cast iron block braked vehicles was in the expected range. Additionally, it could be observed that standard procedures in infrastructure and freight wagon maintenance do not ensure a sustained noise reduction. Several effects destroy this noise reduction. Measures to ensure a qualified noise reduction sustained for the full lifetime of a freight wagon were identified.},

	abstract = {Interior noise and vibration reduction has become one important concern of railway operating environments due to the influence of increased speeds and reduced vehicle weights for energy efficiency. Three types of viscoelastic damping materials, bitumen-based damping material, water-based damping coating and butyl rubber damping material, were developed to reduce the vibration and noise within railway vehicles. Two sleeper carriages were furnished with the new materials in different patterns of constrained-layer and free-layer damping treatment. The measurements of vibration and noise were carried out in three running carriages. It is found that the reduction effect of damping treatments depends on the running speed. The unweighted root-mean-square acceleration is reduced by 0.08–0.79 and 0.06–0.49\&\#xa0;m/s2 for the carriage treated by bitumen-based as well as water-based damping materials and water-based damping material, respectively. The first two materials reduce vibration in a wider frequency range of 63–1000\&\#xa0;Hz than the last. It turns out that the damping treatments of the first two reduce the interior noise level by 5–8\&\#xa0;dBA within the carriage, and the last damping material by 1–6\&\#xa0;dBA. However, the specific loudness analysis of noises shows that the noise components between 125 and 250\&\#xa0;Hz are dominant for the overall loudness, although the low-frequency noise is noticeably decreased by the damping materials. The measure of loudness is shown to be more accurate to assess reduction effect of the damping material on the acoustic comfort.},

A stabilised Michelson interferometer is used to measure the out-of-plane displacement of the surface wave.

	abstract = {Shelling is one of the typical rolling contact fatigue (RCF) failures of railway wheels. Creepage between wheels and rails due to rolling radius difference in curves is inevitable on railway tracks. Therefore, there are tangential stresses and slip phenomena on wheel treads. Eventually, initiation of RCF cracks being the origin of shelling is accelerated by creepage.

The objective of the present paper is to evaluate RCF property of railway wheel steel. The effect of the slip ratio on the RCF strength of the railway wheel steel was evaluated. RCF tests were conducted using two cylindrical contact specimens under water lubrication at a slip ratio of 0.0–1.0\%. The range of slip ratio is determined to assume a creepage between wheel and rail during curving. As a result, it was found that the traction coefficient increased with the increase in the slip ratio, and the fatigue strength decreased simultaneously. The results were evaluated by a shakedown map and Hirakawa’s RCF map. Experimental fatigue limits could be expressed more precisely by the criterion of Hirakawa’s RCF map than that expressed by the well-known shakedown map.

Stress intensity factors (SIFs) of the cracks produced by the RCF test were calculated by finite element (FE) analysis where the effect of water pressure due to the penetration of water into the cracks is taken into account. Two peaks of the maximum tangential SIF occurred during one cycle of rolling contact. The direction of the crack propagation was estimated by the maximum tangential stress criteria. The results of the RCF test showed that the cracks were initiated at the surface, propagated obliquely in the depth direction and then branched into two directions. One was towards the surface and the other was towards the depth. These two crack directions were inspected experimentally, corresponding to the estimated crack directions from the two peaks of SIF by FE analysis. The effect of slip ratio on RCF crack propagation was discussed by using the SIFs of the RCF cracks where water penetration into the cracks was considered.},

In previous work a twin disc approach has been used to study the effect of sand (used to improve adhesion) and leaves on wheel/rail isolation. Friction modifiers are of significant current interest in wheel/rail research. Introducing a new material into the tread/top of rail interface can raise questions about the impact on signalling systems. Although no significant effects have been observed in practical operation on a range of railway systems, the intention in this work was to evaluate conductance between wheel and rail in a more controlled and systematic fashion using the previously established methodology. Using the twin disc technique, friction modifier, in the form of a solid stick, was applied using a spring loaded device to the rotating wheel disc to generate a visible film. Tests were run to measure contact impedance at typical loads and slips. Static tests were also carried out using discs pre-conditioned with a friction modifier film. The electrical circuit used was a modified simplified simulation of audio frequency track circuit.

No significant difference was observed in the measured impedance for dry conditions with no friction modifier, versus tests where friction modifier was applied, regardless of percentage slip or input voltage. The analysis suggests that the introduction of friction modifier into the existing wheel/rail interfacial film does not result in increased impedance with all other factors being equal.},

	abstract = {Surface roughness evaluation is very important for many fundamental problems such as friction, contact deformation, heat and electric current conduction, tightness of contact joints and positional accuracy. For this reason surface roughness has been the subject of experimental and theoretical investigations for many decades. The real surface geometry is so complicated that a finite number of parameters cannot provide a full description. If the number of parameters used is increased, a more accurate description can be obtained. This is one of the reasons for introducing new parameters for surface evaluation. Surface roughness parameters are normally categorised into three groups according to its functionality. These groups are defined as amplitude parameters, spacing parameters, and hybrid parameters. This paper illustrates the definitions and the mathematical formulae for about 59 of the roughness parameters. This collection of surface roughness parameter was used in a new software computer vision package called SurfVision developed by the authors. In the package, these definitions were extended to calculate the 3D surface topography of different specimens.},

According to the United States Federal Railroad Administration Office of Safety Analysis,[1] track defects are the second leading cause of accidents on railways in the United States. The leading cause of railway accidents is attributed to human error. The contribution of poor management decisions to rail accidents caused by infrequent or inadequate rail inspection is significant but not reported by the FRA, only the NTSB. Every year, North American railroads spend millions of dollars to inspect the rails for internal and external flaws. Nondestructive testing (NDT) methods are used as a preventative measures against track failures and possible derailment.},

However, the precise type and dose of exercise needed to accrue health benefits is a contentious issue with no clear consensus recommendations for the prevention of inactivity-related disorders and chronic diseases. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that high-intensity interval training (HIT) can serve as an effective alternate to traditional endurance-based training, inducing similar or even superior physiological adaptations in healthy individuals and diseased populations, at least when compared on a matched-work basis. While less well studied, low-volume HIT can also stimulate physiological remodelling comparable to moderate-intensity continuous training despite a substantially lower time commitment and reduced total exercise volume. Such findings are important given that ‘lack of time' remains the most commonly cited barrier to regular exercise participation. Here we review some of the mechanisms responsible for improved skeletal muscle metabolic control and changes in cardiovascular function in response to low-volume HIT. We also consider the limited evidence regarding the potential application of HIT to people with, or at risk for, cardiometabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes. Finally, we provide insight on the utility of low-volume HIT for improving performance in athletes and highlight suggestions for future research.},

The thickness of the laser alloyed layer varied from 0.5 to 7.0 mm. The microstructure of the laser alloyed layer changed with increasing Fe content from hypo-eutectic structure to hyper-eutectic structure with needle-like FeAl3, fine needle-like FeAl3 and finally lump-like Fe2Al5 compounds, and their hardnesses were HV100, HV100-300, HV300-500 and HV600-1000, respectively. The alloyed layers with the fine needle-like FeAl3 and Fe2Al5 compound structures showed the high hardness, HV300 and HV800, respectively, even at elevated temperatures up to 673 K. The wear resistance of the laser alloyed layer increased with increasing the hardness.},

	abstract = {To reduce the mixed fuel induced excessive wear of the cast iron engine cylinder liners, research on laser alloying of NiCr alloy with powder feeding was performed to locally change both the composition and the microstructure of the liner. The research indicated that laser alloying of 75Ni25Cr on grey cast iron liner demonstrates sound alloying layers free of cracks and porosities. The microstructure of the alloyed layer is composed of pre-eutectic austenite and ledeburite. The alloying element Ni is mainly located in the austenite, while Cr is mainly in cementite. The average hardness is HV0.2500. The corrosion resistance of the alloyed layers in diluted H2SO4 solution and NaOH solution is dramatically improved compared to the grey cast iron. The relative wear resistance of the laser-alloyed 75Ni25Cr layer is 4.34 times of that of the grey cast iron. The improvements on the corrosion and wear resistance of the cast iron are attributed to the composition and microstructure change by laser alloying of 75Ni25Cr. Laser alloying can be a good solution to improve wear and corrosion resistance of the grey iron liners in mixed fuel environment.},

They are required on site both for evaluation of existing structures/infrastructure and for quality control in new construction. With this purpose, BAM has carried out in-situ feasibility studies, using radar, impact-echo and ultrasonic-echo methods. Two examples are given of their combined application on different railway slab–track constructions, using high frequency radar, scanning impact-echo and ultrasonic array methods. The aim was to evaluate limitations and advantages, comparability and complementarity of these methods. The on-site measurements demonstrated the possibility to investigate, with good accuracy via NDT, the bonding conditions between sleepers and slab, to locate voids and measure layer thickness. The acoustic and electromagnetic methods used, were found to be complementary.},

	abstract = {The ability to detect defects in rail, and in particular surface defects such as gauge corner cracking, is essential. Current ultrasonic testing of the rail uses contacting transducers in a send-receive mode which are at present limited in testing speed to around 20–30\&\#xa0;mph, and signals from serious surface defects may be masked by nearby shallow surface defects. Using Rayleigh-like surface waves generated and detected in a pitch-catch manner we can overcome the effect of this masking, and by using electro-magnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) working at a small standoff we may be able to lift many of the current rail testing speed limitations with a high accuracy for detecting and gauging surface defects. We present experiments on rail samples with real and machined defects, using EMATs to generate and detect a low-frequency wide-band surface wave. The depths of the defects can be characterised through analysis of both the time domain signal amplitude and frequency dependent behaviour. The design of EMAT used is discussed, with consideration of signal, frequency content, directionality of the signal and the effect of standoff above the sample.},

In particular, the consequences of short-pitch rail corrugation on tangent track with wavelengths in the interval 3–8\&\#xa0;cm are simulated using models of dynamic vehicle–track interaction. Based on the calculated results, a criterion in terms of a limit for maximum levels of rail roughness with respect to the current traffic conditions can be determined. Such a criterion may be useful for planning of rail grinding intervals if used together with a system for regular monitoring of rail roughness levels. It is concluded that the importance of controlling rail roughness increases with increasing train speed. Increasing axle loads on freight vehicles from 22.5 tonnes to 30 tonnes leads to a significant increase in RCF impact. In operational practice, this is usually compensated for by introducing more conformal wheel–rail profile combinations. Calculated vertical wheel–rail contact forces and rolling noise levels show good agreement with field measurements.},

The bogie consists of two frames, with one placed on top of the other, and two axle ties connecting the axles. Each frame consists of two side arms and a transom between. The top frame is thinner and more compliant and has a higher curvature compared with the bottom frame. Variable vertical stiffness can be achieved before and after the contact between the two frames at the central section of the bogie to cope with different load levels. Finite element analysis played a very important role in the design of this structure. Stiffness and stress levels of the full scale bogie presented in this paper under various loading conditions have been predicted by using Marc provided by MSC Software. In order to verify the finite element analysis (FEA) models, a fifth scale prototype of the bogie has been made and tested under quasi-static loading conditions. Results of testing on the fifth scale bogie have been used to fine tune details like contact and friction in the fifth scale FEA models. These conditions were then applied to the full scale models. Finite element analysis results show that the stress levels in all directions are low compared with material strengths.},

When compared with the airplane, high speed trains are able to compete for short and medium distances, with the advantage of having better energy efficiency and causing less pollution. However, to maintain the operational performance of railway vehicles, it is necessary that the quality of the wheel–rail contact is controlled, which requires, among others, a good understanding of the wear mechanisms of the wheels and the consequences of their changing profile on vehicle dynamics. In this work, a computational tool that is able to predict the evolution of the wheel profiles for a given railway system, as a function of the distance run, is presented. The strategy adopted consists of a commercial multibody software to study the railway dynamic problem and a purpose-built code for managing its pre and post-processing data in order to compute the wear. Three alternative wear functions are implemented to compute the amount of worn material on the railway wheels. The computational tool is applied here to a realistic operational scenario in order to demonstrate its capabilities on wear prediction. Special attention is given to the comparison of the results obtained with the different wear functions implemented in this work and to the global and local contact models used in such formulations.},

Surface films were investigated locally by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) after having prepared thin cross-sections with a focused ion beam instrument (FIB). Since the observed friction layers revealed a nanocrystalline structure, modelling with the method of movable cellular automata (MCA) was performed by assuming an array of linked nanometer-sized particles. In spite of complicated material combinations at the pad surface, two very characteristic features were always observed at both the pad and disc surface, namely a steel constituent—either ferritic (pad) or pearlitic (disc), partly covered with patches of nanocrystalline iron oxide, on a zone of severe plastic deformation with fragmented grain structure. When using an automata size of 10\&\#xa0;nm, reasonable values for the mean coefficient of friction (COF) were obtained, namely 0.35 and 0.85 for oxide-on-oxide and metal-on-metal contacts, respectively. Immediately after brake application mass-mixing and bond-breaking was observed within a narrow zone at both surfaces.},

However, the surface effects stemming from the sample surface topography and friction are the most pronounced in shallow indentation depths, potentially resulting in variations of the evaluated material parameters. A numerical study is conducted to understand the coupled influence of friction and sample surface roughness in nanoindentation of pure nickel. Results show a strong interaction between these two contributions of surface effects, and their cumulative effect leads to significant variations in the load–displacement curves. Two experimentally used post-treatment methods are applied to obtain the elastic properties from the raw numerical data and a large variation in the evaluated elastic modulus is observed comparable to experimental dispersion levels, independently of the post-treatment method. This suggests that the coupled effect of roughness and friction may at least partially explain the dispersion otherwise attributed to the tested material behavior. Surface effects are found to contribute significantly to the energy balance of shallow nanoindentations, raising the question of the interpretation of the evaluated plastic material properties with work of indentation based methods.},

This study is the first attempt to independently model the effect of kurtosis and skewness on the static friction and friction coefficient. It is predicted that surfaces with high kurtosis and positive skewness exhibit lower static friction coefficient compared to the Gaussian case. More importantly, it is predicted that, for high kurtosis values, the static friction coefficient decreases with decreasing external force rather than increasing as seen with increasing skewness. This is a very promising result for applications involving smooth lightly loaded contacts such as magnetic storage devices and microelectromechanical systems. The practical significance of the present model is specifically demonstrated on static friction predictions in magnetic storage head–disk interfaces. Such predictions can be used to determine the optimal characteristics of such devices prior to fabrication to achieve lower friction in terms of surface roughness, mechanical properties, apparent contact area, and operational environment.},

	abstract = {With increasing activities on micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) type microactuators, there is a growing need in understanding the tribological properties of silicon, the most commonly used wafer material for those devices. In particular, it is of interest if single crystal silicon used in microactuators exposed to rather low vertical loads is subject to wear. Therefore, wear tests using monocrystalline silicon on both sides of the tribological interface were conducted.

A classic way to measure wear on sliders in contact with a tape or a rotating disk is to create an imprint using a Berkovich diamond tip mounted on a picoindenter. However, in our case we used a different approach. We created three studs on a slider’s surface by recessing the material outside the studs through an ion milling process. During the wear tests, the studs wore off. By measuring the remaining stud height, the wear volume could be determined at any point in time. The tests were performed on a pin on disk tester with a gimbaled slider to realize a flat on flat contact and a rather low normal force of 30\&\#xa0;mN.},

	abstract = {The application of PVD coatings on low-alloy steels for the protection against wear and corrosion, may allow the substitution of high-alloy steel materials, which are used for applications under mechanical-corrosive loads. This could prolong the component lifetime and save costs.

A pretreatment method, which may improve the corrosion resistance of PVD coated low-alloy steel, is plasma-nitriding of the substrate. So far there were no investigations to quantify the influence of plasma-nitriding on the corrosion behaviour of PVD coated low-alloy steel. Hence one objective of this study was to quantify this influence by means of polarisation tests with determination of corrosion potentials and corrosion current densities. Furthermore the influence of plasma-nitriding of the substrate on the wear properties of PVD coated low-alloy steel was investigated. Moreover the influence of surface roughness on the corrosion properties of PVD coated low-alloy steel was an aim of this study. The investigated PVD coatings were new graded zirconium carbide layers (ZrCg) and graded chromium carbide layers (CrCg).

The tests revealed, that higher roughness leads to worse corrosion protection by the investigated PVD coatings. This can be explained by the number of defects in the layer, which rises with increasing roughness and which allows the penetration of corrosive media to the substrate and thus accelerates corrosion underneath the film. The tests in artificial sea water in accordance with DIN 50905 did not show corrosive attacks on the tested films themselves. Plasma-nitriding of the substrate resulted in significantly higher corrosion potentials and significantly lower corrosion rates for the PVD coated specimens. The positive influence of plasma-nitriding of the substrate on the wear behaviour has been less pronounced. Only when higher normal forces were applied, which allowed the counter body to have direct frictional contact with the substrate, the wear was reduced due to plasma-nitriding.

In summary, plasma-nitriding of the substrate is beneficial for achieving good corrosion and wear properties for PVD coatings on low-alloy steel. However a special focus has to be put on a proper pretreatment of the surface, which has to be as smooth as possible.},

The experimental results showed a strong difference in the influence of initial surface quality on the tribological performance in isooctane or distilled water, particularly when rougher surfaces were mated. Depending on the surface finishing, the tests run in the boundary or mixed lubrication regimes and both the friction coefficient and the wear intensity displayed a transition from high to low values after a period of running-in.

A three-pin-on-disk tester was used, operating at 0.18 m s−1, with a pressure of 1.0 MPa on 5 mm diameter pin. Specific wear rates were calculated from mass lost by the pins at 15 km intervals and friction force was monitored by a strain-gauged torque beam. Two series of 90-km tests were performed for each pin/disk combination. The stainless steel disks had either a fine-ground or polished surface. The roughness of the ground stainless steel surface was chosen to coincide with the optimum value for low wear rate of the PEEK pins. To maximise pin/disk contact area, the PEEK and APC2 pin surfaces were run-in on 1000-grit silicon carbide paper and ultrasonically cleaned in acetone before the first wear test. There was no significant difference in steady-state wear between these pins and those tested with as-moulded surfaces. The disks were analysed at 15 km intervals with the UBM profilometer, providing 3D surface scans and 2D profiles for roughness parameters without damaging the wear track. All the surface roughness parameters reported in this work were produced from thhe UBM non-contacting optical profilometer. A marked difference in specific wear rate was observed between the two types of PEEK. The 450G had the lowest wear of 6 × 10 −6 mm3 N−1 m−1 on both the polished and ground counterface, whereas the 100P had wear factors of 1 × 10−4 mm3 N−1 m−1 on ground and 2 × 10−5 mm3 N−1 m−1 on polished stainless steel. However, the friction forces measured between the 450G PEEK and the polished disk were up to three times higher than those against the ground disk, (0.35±0.01), decreasing to similar values as the polished surface became scratched. The APC2 pins showed very little difference in wear rate between the ground and polished disks. However, a steady decrease from 1 × 10−6 to 1 × 10−7 mm3 N−1 m−1 over a distance of 90 km was measured as more fibres were ground into a graphite transfer film lubricant and the coefficient of friction dropped from 0.35 to 0.18. The specific wear rates and coefficients of friction of the APC2 samples were lower than those for PEEK, however, the APC2 caused more scratch deformation of the polished steel counterface.},

In this study, the effect of surface roughness on friction and sliding wear of two different coatings, one tungsten containing and one chromium containing coating, were examined using a ball-on-disc test. Ball bearing steel plates were grinded to different surface roughnesses and coated with the two different coatings.

The friction was found to depend on surface roughness where the rougher surfaces gave higher friction coefficients. The wear rate for the a-C:W coating was found to be independent of the roughness, whereas the roughness had a strong influence on the wear rate for the a-C:Cr coating. This could partly be explained by a difference in wear mechanism, where fatigue wear was observed for the a-C:Cr coating but not for the a-C:W coating.},

The present paper describes a series of sliding experiments which show somewhat curious behavior of BN when added to lubricating oil, and discusses their results by comparing with the results of observation and analysis of sliding surfaces. In the case of sliding of bearing steel vs. itself, BN slightly increased the coefficient of friction, but dramatically decreased wear. Boron was found to remain on the surfaces, but the remnant was almost oxidized; it was some sort of oxide but not stoichiometric. If bearing steel was slid against cast iron, BN decreased the coefficient of friction, but the decrease in wear was less marked, and the remnant in this case was mostly BN. These results show that BN is effective in reducing wear if used as a lubricant additive.},

One key issue that affects the application of wear debris analysis for machine condition monitoring is whether the morphology of the wear particles accurately depicts their original states and the surface morphology of the components from which the particles separate. This study aimed to investigate the evolution of the surface morphology of wear debris in relation to change in the surface morphology of wear components in sliding wear process. Sliding wear tests were conducted using a ball-on-disc tester under proper lubrication and improper lubrication conditions. The study of the particle size distribution and the surfaces of both the wear debris and the tested samples in relation to the wear condition and the wear rates of the wear components were carried out in this study. The evolutions of the surface topographies of both the wear debris and the wear components as wear progressed were investigated. This study has provided insight to the progress of material degradation through the study of wear debris. The results of this research have clearly demonstrated that: (a) there is a good correlation of the surface morphology of wear debris and that of the wear components, and (b) the surface morphology of wear debris contains valuable information for machine condition monitoring.},

Tests were conducted at sliding speeds of 0.178 and 0.330\&\#xa0;m/s for sliding distances of 100\&\#xa0;m. Normal loads of 51 and 204\&\#xa0;N were applied, and initial Ra surface roughnesses of the rings along the sliding direction were either smooth (∼0.2\&\#xa0;μm) or rough (∼7.5\&\#xa0;μm). Increased initial ring roughness caused a ∼20-fold increase in rod wear at the lighter load, whereas at the heavier load increased initial roughness only caused a ∼4-fold increase in wear. At lower initial ring roughness the 4-fold decrease in normal load caused a large (one order-of-magnitude) decrease in rod wear, whereas for rings of higher initial roughness the 4-fold decrease in normal load caused only minor (2-fold or less) decreases in rod wear. Wear during this 100\&\#xa0;m sliding distance only experienced a minor effect from the 1.8-fold change in sliding speed, as did friction. In all cases friction coefficient rapidly settled into the range 0.6–0.7, except in the cases of lower load on rings of lower initial roughness where friction coefficient remained above 1 for most of this sliding duration. At this lower load the initial ∼0.2\&\#xa0;μm rod roughnesses increased to nearly 0.8\&\#xa0;μm by the 100\&\#xa0;m sliding distance, whereas at the higher load this same sliding distance resulted in roughnesses returning near to the initial 0.2\&\#xa0;μm. It was hypothesized more highly loaded cases also went through initial roughening prior to smoothening back to 0.2\&\#xa0;μm roughness within the 100\&\#xa0;m sliding distance, and given additional sliding the more lightly loaded cases would also experience subsequent smoothening. Increasing sliding distance to 400\&\#xa0;m, roughnesses indicated a smoothening back to 0.2\&\#xa0;μm level during those lightly loaded tests, with friction coefficient correspondingly dropping from 1 into the 0.6–0.7 range observed in all other cases. Extended sliding to 400\&\#xa0;m at light loading against rings of lower initial roughness also allowed a rod wear rate which increased with increased sliding distance to be observed, approaching the same rate observed against initially rough rings within the 100\&\#xa0;m sliding distance.},

This type of volumetric inspection is desirable when testing engineering components that have an inherent 3D internal structure or may contain defects orientated at a range of angles. One potential industrial application for this technology is the in-situ inspection of jet-engine turbine blades for root cracking. However, modern turbine blades are manufactured from single crystals of nickel-based superalloys for the excellent mechanical properties these materials exhibit at elevated temperatures. Single-crystal materials are elastically anisotropic, which causes ultrasonic waves to propagate with different velocities depending on the direction of the wave. If unaddressed, this significantly reduces the quality of the inspection and the 3D images that can be produced with an ultrasonic array. In this paper, a model of wave propagation in anisotropic media is used to correct an ultrasonic imaging algorithm to enable the reliable volumetric inspection of single-crystal aerospace components.},

Tests to varying fractions of rolling contact fatigue (RCF) life have been assessed, based on twin disc tests where “average 100\% RCF life” has been defined by eddy current detection of cracks between 200 and 800\&\#xa0;μm in depth. Contact surface features and microstructural alterations have been mapped against near-surface strain and compared with worn rail examinations. Initial crack growth along favourably aligned and strained, prior-austenite (PA) grain boundaries, particularly if the boundary contains pro-eutectoid (PE) ferrite, was found to be restricted or halted at the PA grain limit or where the boundary altered to be less-favourably aligned. For samples with up to 55\% RCF life, initial crack propagation length was still less than the average PA grain size. 3D aspects of this early growth and the deformed PA grain shapes were found to be linked to ratcheting flakes and flake cracks on test disc and rail contact surfaces. The results have shown how initial RCF crack propagation is very microstructurally influenced.},

This in turn allows better understanding of the rail characteristics that require improvements and is used to extend rail's life. Recent research has focused on methods to streamline the developments of prototype rail steels using laboratory tribotests. The results of the tribotests indicate that sliding ball-on-disk experiments can be used to qualitatively approximate rail wear and using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) it is possible to observe different tribological behaviour between rails (mild to severe wear). For instance, SEM micrograph analysis can lead to the determination of the propensity of rail crack formation under pure sliding and the detrimental effects of pro-eutectoid cementite and hard inclusions (e.g., Al2O3) on crack formation and delamination.},

A popular practice is the application of friction modifiers to increase the adhesion level in contaminated wheel–rail contacts. Two friction modifiers have particularly been used or tested on several railway networks as adhesion enhancers to facilitate the traction and braking operation under poor adhesion conditions. However, for assessment of the performance the railway operators and infrastructure managers mostly rely on practical observations that do not elucidate completely the effectiveness and side effects of these adhesion enhancers. In this paper, the constituents of the two friction modifiers are identified and the solid components are analyzed. A twin-disk roller rig has been used to study their performance in dry and wet contacts under closely controlled laboratory conditions. The adhesion characteristics of both friction modifiers are examined for different slip ratios. Furthermore, the wheel and rail disks are examined after a series of dry tests to analyze the mass loss, the surface damage, the change in surface hardness and roughness, and the subsurface deformation caused by the friction modifiers compared to dry clean contacts.},

A numerical method using VAMPIRE for modelling the dynamic performance of a wagon passing through a turnout is presented with a special focus on wheel–rail wear. The objective is to investigate the potential benefit for operational strategies with respect to minimising wheel–rail wear. The simulations show that the travel speed significantly affects the wheel–rail wear at turnouts and that due to vehicle–track dynamics an optimal passing speed will exist that will minimise wear.},

	abstract = {Tribology has been described as a young science with fundamentally new forms of tribology yet to be devised [1]. Since its birth in the 1960s the tribology has primarily been focused on solving the immediate industrial problems with wear and friction through the application of better materials, novel surface technologies, improved lubricants and lubrication methods. Once these immediate problems have been solved the research focus has shifted to the newly emerging areas like nanotechnology and biotribology. A new branch of nanotechnology, nanotribology, is now rapidly developing [2]. Nanotribology, as its name suggests, is the study of tribology in minute contacts such as those used in nanotechnology. The increasing pace of research and development generates a need to almost predict in advance what these developments will be. Will there be major advances in our fundamental knowledge of tribology? Will the range of application of tribology be significantly extended? In this chapter, some clues to future developments, based on currently available information, are briefly presented.},

	abstract = {Although the wear and friction of non-metallic solids have some fundamental similarities to that of metals, there are also significant differences in the wear mechanisms involved and the level of friction or wear which occurs. These differences can be exploited to produce valuable new bearing materials which can change commonly accepted expectations of tribological performance. An example of this is a common polymer called Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) which can provide a coefficient of friction as low as 0.05 in the complete absence of any lubricant. However, not all of the differences in tribological characteristics of metals and non-metals are in favour of the non-metals. For example, PTFE is soft and has a very high wear rate so that for most applications it must be blended carefully with other materials before a useful bearing material is created. A careful study of the tribology of non-metallic materials is a pre-requisite to their successful adaptation as bearing or wear resistant materials. Questions such as: in what applications should polymers be applied as bearing materials? Are the polymers superior to metals as bearing materials? Will ceramic bearing wear out a metal shaft? These and many others are of considerable interest to engineers.},

This wear is caused by deformations sustained by the asperities and surface layers when the asperities of opposing surfaces make contact.

Wear under these conditions is determined by the mechanics of crack initiation, crack growth and fracture. Worn surfaces contain very high levels of plastic strain compared to unworn surfaces. This strain and the consequent modification of the material's microstructure have a strong effect on the wear processes.},

Both these forms of wear share the surprising characteristic that a rapid wear rate is usually accompanied by a diminished coefficient of friction. This divergence between friction and wear is a very useful identifier of these wear processes. The questions are: how can corrosive and oxidative wear be controlled? To what extent do the chemical reactions and corrosion processes dictate the mechanism and rate of wear? Are corrosive and oxidative wear relatively benign or can they cause immediate failure of machinery? The answers to these questions are in the understanding of the mechanisms of corrosive and oxidative wear which are discussed in this chapter.},

Most lubricant failures in sliding metal contacts result in adhesive wear since this relates to a breakdown in the lubricant's basic function of providing some degree of separation between the sliding surfaces. If sliding surfaces are not separated, adhesion and subsequent wear are almost inevitable. The questions of practical importance are: which metals are most prone to adhesion and adhesive wear? How can adhesive wear be recognized and controlled? In this chapter the process of adhesion between surfaces is described together with the resulting wear mechanism.},

Abrasive wear is the loss of material by the passage of hard particles over a surface [1]. Erosive wear is caused by the impact of particles against a solid surface. Cavitation is caused by the localized impact of fluid against a surface during the collapse of bubbles. Abrasion and erosion in particular are rapid and severe forms of wear and can result in significant costs if not adequately controlled [2]. Although all three forms of wear share some common features, there are also some fundamental differences, e.g., a particle of liquid can cause erosion but cannot abrade. These differences extend to the practical consideration of materials selection for wear resistance due to the different microscopic mechanisms of wear occurring in abrasion, erosion or cavitation. The questions are: where are abrasive, erosive or cavitation wear likely to occur? When do these forms of wear occur and how can they be recognized? What are the differences and similarities between them? Will the same protective measures, e.g., material reinforcement, be suitable for all these forms of wear? What is the effect of temperature on these wear mechanisms? Will the use of hard materials suppress all or only some of these forms of wear? The practising engineer needs answers to all these questions and more. The fundamental mechanisms involved in these three forms of wear and the protective measures that can be taken against them are discussed in this chapter.},

	abstract = {Surfaces of solids represent a very complex form of matter, far more complicated than a mere plane. There is a variety of defects and distortions present on any real surface. These surface features, ranging from bulk distortions of the surface to local microscopic irregularities, exert a strong influence on friction and wear. The imperfections and features of a real surface influence the chemical reactions which occur with contacting liquids or lubricants while the visible roughness of most surfaces controls the mechanics of contact between the solids and the resulting wear. The study of surfaces is relatively recent and the discoveries so far give rise to a wide range of questions for the technologist or tribologist, such as: what is the optimum surface? Is there a particular type of optimum surface for any specific application? Why are sliding surfaces so prone to thermal damage? How can wear particles be formed by plastic deformation when the operating loads between contacting surfaces are relatively very low? Although some of these questions can be answered with the current level of knowledge, the others remain as fundamental research topics. The characteristics of friction are also of profound importance to engineering practice. Seemingly mundane phenomena, such as the difference between static and kinetic friction, are still not properly understood and their control to prevent technical problems remains imperfect. The basic question: what is the mechanism of ‘stick-slip’?, i.e., the vibration of sliding elements caused by a large difference between static and kinetic friction, has yet to be answered.

Solid lubricants can also provide lubrication at extremes of temperature, under vacuum conditions or in the presence of strong radioactivity. Oil usually cannot be used under these conditions.

The scope of solid lubrication has, however, been greatly extended by new technologies for depositing the solid film onto the wearing surface.

The questions then are: how are the interacting machine components lubricated and what is the lubrication mechanism involved? The models of lubrication which are thought to operate under such conditions are discussed in this chapter. The traditional name for this type of lubrication is ‘boundary lubrication’ or ‘boundary and extreme-pressure lubrication’. Neither of these terms describes accurately the processes at work since they were conceived long before any fundamental understanding of the mechanisms was available. Several specialized modes of lubrication such as adsorption, surface localized viscosity enhancement, amorphous layers and sacrificial films are commonly involved in this lubrication regime to ensure the smooth-functioning and reliability of machinery. The imprecise nature of present knowledge about these modes or mechanisms of lubrication contrasts with their practical importance. Many vital items of engineering equipment such as steel gears, piston-rings and metal-working tools depend on one or more of these lubrication modes to prevent severe wear or high coefficients of friction and seizure.},

	abstract = {In hydrostatic lubrication the bearing surfaces are fully separated by a lubricating film of liquid or gas forced between the surfaces by an external pressure. The pressure is generated by an external pump instead of by viscous drag as is the case with hydrodynamic lubrication. As long as a continuous supply of pressurized lubricant is maintained, a complete film is present even at zero sliding speed. Hydrostatic films usually have a considerable thickness reaching 100 [μm] and therefore prevent contact between the asperities of even the roughest surfaces. This ensures a complete absence of sticking friction. Furthermore, the friction generated by viscous shear of the lubricant decreases to zero at zero sliding speed. Hydrostatic bearings can support very large masses and allow them to be moved from their stationary positions with the use of minimal force. These extraordinary features of zero static friction and high load capacity were applied, for example, in the 5.08 [m] diameter Mount Palomar telescope and in many radar installations. With other types of bearing, starting friction is inevitable and can cause distortion and damage to large structures. This problem is critical to the design of large telescopes which rely on extreme accuracy of telescope positioning.},

For many years some heroic attempts were made to solve these equations using specialized and obscure mathematical functions but this process was tedious and the range of solutions was limited. A gap or discrepancy always existed between what was required in the engineering solutions to hydrodynamic problems and the solutions available. Before numerical methods were developed, analogue methods, such as electrically conductive paper, were experimented with as a means of determining hydrodynamic pressure fields. These methods became largely obsolete with the advancement of numerical methods to solve differential equations. This change radically affected the general understanding and approach to hydrodynamic lubrication and other subjects, e.g., heat transfer. It is now possible to incorporate in the numerical analysis of the bearing common features such as heat transfer from a bearing to its housing. The application of traditional, analytical methods would require to assume that the bearing is either isothermal or adiabatic. Numerical solutions to hydrodynamic lubrication problems can now satisfy most engineering requirements for prediction of bearing characteristics and improvements in the quality of prediction continue to be found. In engineering practice problems such as what is the maximum size of the groove to reduce friction before lubricant leakage becomes excessive or how does bending of the pad affect the load capacity of a bearing, need to be solved.},

	abstract = {Before discussing lubrication and wear mechanisms, some information about lubricants is necessary. What are lubricants made of, and what are their properties? Are oils different from greases? Can mineral oils be used in high performance engines? Which oils are the most suitable for application to gears, bearings, etc.? What criteria should they meet? What is the oil viscosity, viscosity index, pressure-viscosity coefficient? How can these parameters be determined? What are the thermal properties and temperature characteristics of lubricants? An engineer should know the answers to all these questions.},

The constitutive equation of the slurry is a non-Newtonian formulation based on experimental data. The model includes provisions for elastic/plastic deformation of particles in the slurry. Through this deformation, particles are shown to contribute to the load-carrying capacity. The viscosity of the carrier fluid is shown to increase considerably as a result of adding a large amount of particles, thus appreciably affecting the EHL behavior of powder slurries. Performance results are presented for the pressure profile, film thickness, temperature distribution, and traction coefficient for a number of sliding/rolling ratios. The existence of particles in slurry is shown to give rise to a higher temperature field and tends to increase the traction coefficient compared to typical shear thinning fluids.},

	abstract = {Rolling contact fatigue (RCF) is currently one of the principal limitations of railway infrastructure productivity. Head checks in particular are prevalent in curves and switches where flange contact at the gauge corner results in increased slip and decreased wheel–rail contact area. These surface-initiated cracks can lead to complete failure of the rail and potentially derailment. The focus of the EU Fifth Framework project InfraStar is on improving the durability and lifetime of the rail along stretches of track with narrow and moderate radius curve, high-traffic volumes and high axle loads by applying a surface coating to the railhead. The main goal of the project is to develop a railhead with an additional surface layer (the InfraStar two-material rail) which prevents RCF and reduces noise emissions in narrow-radius curved rail.

Results are presented here from twin-disc laboratory testing and metallurgical analysis of specimens with the two selected new surface materials. The effects of lubrication, applied load and coating thickness were studied. An eddy current probe was used for crack detection. Both materials survived 200,000 cycles of water-lubricated twin-disc testing without crack formation, in contrast to UIC (260 grade) 900A base material which showed severe cracking after only 4000 cycles. Metallurgical investigations show excellent RCF resistance, although one coating developed cracks quickly during water-lubricated testing after 15,000 dry cycles, and bonding of the tested coatings (delamination occurred at the bonding interface of one coating during high-pressure tests).},

The strategy presented is utilised and evaluated for two RCF examples: (i) a twin disc test, and (ii) a railway wheel–rail rolling contact. The results from both of the examples verify that the strategy and evaluation methodology presented can be used for fatigue life predictions of RCF crack initiation caused by low-cycle fatigue and ratchetting failure.},

However, the complexity of modelling the ratchetting phenomenon and the uncertainties on the material’s critical ratchet strain, suggests that perhaps a more realistic alternative is the use of empirical Wöhler-like life curves similarly to currently used for the contact fatigue evaluation in gears design and standards. In particular, it is found that the “pitting” fatigue limit at 107 cycles suggested by the gears standard is reasonably accurate also for the C\&amp;S experiments on various typical rail steels. Since the gears life factor suggested for gears turns out quite conservative at shorter lives, it seems a single new life factor could be suggested, at least for all pearlitic and bainitic steels tested by C\&amp;S under water lubrication.},

At some point the material loses its integrity and fails, and this failure is manifested in the form of wear (the material detaching from the surface and producing debris) or rolling contact fatigue (initiation of micro-cracks which may subsequently propagate and branch). Models of such contacts have been developed based on ductility exhaustion [Wear 245 (2000) 204; Int. J. Fatigue 22 (2000) 205].

For wear, the material is divided into layers and each layer accumulates shear strain dependent on the stress at that depth; once a layer has accumulated a critical shear strain it is deemed to have failed. In the work presented here, the models are improved by allowing variation with depth of material properties such as ductility and shear yield stress. This reflects the statistical variation of real materials arising from the microstructure.

For rolling contact fatigue, ductility exhaustion has been taken to mean initiation of a micro-crack. However, this introduces ambiguity since ductility exhaustion is also the cause of wear of material from the surface. The suggestion, here, is that the dilemma can be resolved by considering a model which has a brick wall structure. Each material brick can lose integrity and thus fail. Dependent on whether the failed material is supported by adjacent bricks which are intact, the material may detach to produce wear debris. Bricks which fail but do not detach (either at the surface or below it) behave as micro-cracks; these can interact and grow, but can also be lost if the surface material is worn away later.},

The proposed formulation captures the interaction between fluid pressure and solid deflections both at the contact interface and along the crack faces using a fully coupled finite volume/boundary element solver. This sheds light on the mechanisms which govern crack propagation in various loading conditions and geometrical configurations. It is shown that by linking the fluid behaviour and the elastic deflections within the crack to the film formed at the contact interface it is possible to overcome one of the main limitations of classical models available in the literature, which consists of having to prescribe pressure and/or pressure gradient at the crack mouth during the each loading cycle. The application of linear elastic fracture mechanics principles for the determination of crack stress intensity factors suggests that the approach developed by the authors produces a more realistic characterisation of the crack tip behaviour and it is capable of producing an improved estimate of crack propagation rates. Implications of these findings for the development of rolling contact fatigue lifing tools and potential extensions of the technique are also discussed.},

The results showed that depending on the lubrication method, fatigue life could vary by up to an order of magnitude, but that in all cases it was longer than that of a water lubricated contact. It was concluded that under the conditions examined, dry methods of solid lubricant application can offer an effective means of lubrication without the possibility of enhancing rail RCF.

Finally, the ACFM response to clusters of 4 semi-elliptical defects with inter-crack spacings of between 1\&\#xa0;mm and 19\&\#xa0;mm is presented.

We have previously discussed initial experiments using a new dual-probe combining electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) generating and detecting ultrasonic surface waves, and a pulsed eddy current (PEC) sensor [1]. This enables more reliable detection and sizing of surface and near-surface defects, with a reduced testing time compared to using two NDT techniques separately. In this paper, we present experiments using the dual-probe on samples which are more representative of real defects, for example testing for surface defects in rails. Several aluminium calibration samples containing closely spaced and angled slots have been measured, in addition to rail samples containing manufactured and real defects.

In-field dynamic testing in combination with track modelling represents an efficient strategy for identification of the current condition of railway track structure and its components. Field investigations for the dynamic characteristics of a railway track and its components were carried out and are presented in this paper. A non-destructive technique using impact excitation, so-called ‘modal testing’, was utilized in these trials. Integrated approach combining field measurements, experimental modal analysis, and finite element modelling to evaluate the dynamic parameters of the in situ railway track components are appended. A ballasted railway track site in Central Queensland managed by Queensland Rail (QR) was selected to perform the field tests. Six sleeper-fastening-rail assemblies were selected for dynamic testing. The frequency response functions (FRFs) were recorded by using Bruel \&amp; Kjaer PULSE vibration analyser in a frequency domain between 0 and 1600\&\#xa0;Hz. The data obtained were best fitted using the least-square technique to determine the dynamic stiffness and damping constants of the tested track components. In addition, the experimentally determined resonance frequencies along with the dynamic properties of the track components can provide an important input for determining the maximum speed and axle load for the future track upgrades. This paper also points out on how to judge the dynamic responses (e.g. FRFs) together with the visual inspection of existing conditions from the field experience. Examples of testing results representing the deficient integrity are additionally highlighted. Based on the results, the impact excitation technique is an efficient method susceptible to the structural integrity of railway track structures.},

Proposed idea is the evaluation of mechanical stress state of a concrete body (instead of steel cables) via ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation (NDE), by using the link between ultrasonic velocities and mechanical stresses provided by the acoustoelasticity theory. Velocities of the ultrasonic waves (longitudinal and transversal with different polarizations) are observed during propagation through a concrete body submitted to uni-axial loading (compressive testing). Obvious variations in velocity are found depending on the mechanical stress state (e.g. Δc=92\&\#xa0;m/s at σ=16\&\#xa0;MPa for longitudinal waves). Thus acoustoelastic behavior of concrete is demonstrated. Further analyses provide acoustoelastic coefficients of concrete about ten times higher than the common ones of steel.

They also depend on whether the wave is longitudinal or transversal. In this last case, they also depend on the wave polarisation direction.

The present paper deals with the classical acoustoelasticity in stressed and elastically deformed media when they are submitted to bending stresses. A numerical and an experimental evaluation of the resulting change in the ultrasound velocities as a function of bending loads are described. Some results have been obtained on the variation of propagation velocities of the longitudinal and transversal polarised waves as a function of mechanical bending loads applied on samples made of S 185 steel. The acoustoelastic evaluations have been achieved in three zones under bending stress (compressed, central and extended fibres) in the case where the path of probing, longitudinal and linearly polarised shear waves are parallel to the sample axis. As additional investigation on acoustoelastic behaviour on bending load, we propose some acoustoelastic responses simulated numerically on materials of known macroscopic properties.

The experimental study was achieved by means of a measurement set-up composed of an ultrasound bench and a mechanical test machine. In order to measure the variations of the propagation velocity, a correlation technique has been used to obtain an accurate estimation of the propagation time. The velocity measurements have taken into account the elastic deformation of the samples made of carbon steel (C 35).},

The idea came from an experimental observation on a large butt-welded plate which found that the weld can concentrate and guide the energy of a guided wave traveling along the direction of the weld. Modal studies have been carried out previously by the authors which confirmed the existence of such feature guided modes and discussed their properties. These feature guided waves may be reflected by some defects when they are located on the path of the propagation. This paper considers different types of defects, including cracks perpendicular or parallel to the weld and circular holes, all in the heat affected zone next to the weld. The results are obtained from both finite element simulations and experimental measurements, showing good agreement. The sensitivity of two candidate welded-guided modes to different defects is discussed and suitable choices of frequency to detect these defects are suggested.},

Three axisymmetric permanent magnets significantly improved the capability of magnetostrictive transducers compared to two permanent magnets, and effectively increased the amplitude of the longitudinal guided wave mode, L(0, 1) at 160\&\#xa0;kHz. Experimental results show that the maximum amplitude of a received guided wave signal could be obtained by using a receiver with a three-layer coil in parallel and a transmitter with a three-layer coil in series. The amplitudes of the defect-reflected signal increased by as much as 50\% or more as compared with those when both transducers used a single layer coil. As a result, magnetostrictive transducers with an optimized configuration, including permanent magnet distribution and multilayer coil connection, could be efficiently used for the inspection of seven-wire steel strands by using ultrasonic guided waves in a pitch catch arrangement.},

The variations in the round trip time-of-flight (RTOF) of the ultrasonic pulse allow to detect and quantify the flats size.

The logic design optimizes the storage capabilities by keeping only the rail–wheel contact echo and its environment. For this purpose, a wheel tracking algorithm has been implemented. It allows reducing the data volume by controlling the delay time from pulse emission to the acquisition window following the running wheel. Furthermore, since signals are masked by the rail structural noise, they are processed before executing the tracking algorithm.

Firstly the inspection of the wheels—rim and disk—should be carried out without dismantling the wheels and using ultrasonic techniques. On the other hand, the inspection of the railroad track surface at a train speed of about 70 km/h should be guaranteed using eddy current techniques. The above-mentioned tasks were a challenge for the lab staff. The accessibility for the wheel inspection was limited due to several impassable barriers such as sand tubes, etc. Eddy current application focused mainly on the detection of head check defects occurring at the gauge corner of the rail. Investigations carried out also showed, that other types of surface defects (e.g. Belgrospis, wheel burns, short-pitch corrugations, etc.) could easily be detected. Some aspects of the inspection system as well as an overview of test results are presented in the current contribution.},

Results showed that the coefficient of friction increased with the amount of graphite flakes on the gray iron and the effect was more pronounced in the case of using steel-containing linings.

	abstract = {Creep groan (low frequency frictional vibration in the range of 200–500\&\#xa0;Hz during braking at a very low vehicle speed) was studied by changing the relative amounts of ingredients in a brake friction material containing 12 ingredients. Twenty-nine friction material specimens with different relative amounts of the ingredients were manufactured according to a constrained mixture design. The difference (Δμ) between kinetic (μk) and static (μs) coefficients of friction for each formulation was measured to investigate creep groan propensity of each friction material since the creep groan is caused by stick–slip phenomena. Results showed that zircon (zirconium silicate), steel wool, and phenolic resin showed a tendency to increase Δμ. On the other hand, antimony trisulfide, cashew particles, and rockwool tended to reduce Δμ. Based on the results of this work, the initial formulation was modified to reduce Δμ. The modified friction material showed a smaller Δμ value than the initial friction material implying low propensity of creep groan phenomena during braking. The velocity dependence of the friction coefficient was also examined using the initial and the modified friction materials. The modified formulation exhibited a less negative μ–V relation than the initial formulation.},

	abstract = {The paper deals with the principal wear mechanism in brake systems and introduces a new dynamical model of the friction coefficient, where necessarily both friction and wear are taken into account. This model explains many open questions on the principal functionality of brake systems.

In brake systems, characteristic structures are formed in the contact area by the flow of wear particles. Modulated by the friction power the wear particles are used by the system to build up hard contact patches on the brake pad. Nearly all energetic dissipation of the system is concentrated on these patches. By wear, these contact patches are destroyed after some time.

So the friction coefficient is given by the equilibrium of flow of birth and death of contact patches. The resulting dynamical model describes the dynamical behaviour of the friction coefficient and the dependence of the temperature in the friction layer.

This theory explains the fading effect of brake systems as well as complex hysteretic effects in the diagram of the friction coefficient versus the velocity, known from instationary measurement procedures.

The structure of this theory seems to be quite general to describe other frictional systems too.},

The friction material was a polymer matrix composite (PMC) with approximately 50\% metal content (semi-metallic) and the counter part was a cast iron rotor. Though the contact areas were not visible as topographic features, they could be identified with the aid of their increased secondary electron emission during FIB-scanning of the surface after tribological activation. Target preparation of micron-sized cross-sections with the FIB enabled the study of superficial layers at predetermined sites at high magnification.

Depending on the constituent of the pad, one, two or three layers were identified. The three layer structure comprised: (i) a 100\&\#xa0;nm thick friction film containing nanocrystalline metal oxides and an amorphous phase which was enriched with sulphur, (ii) a nanocrystalline friction layer of compacted wear debris accommodating surface roughness and (iii) a severely deformed layer if the supporting constituent was a metal particle. Though the majority of loose wear particles was iron oxide, the friction film which adhered tightly to the pad surface contained a large amount of copper and sulphur, whereas zinc was transferred to the cast iron rotor.},

The exchange of cast iron brake blocks by composite ones is a well-known low-cost measure to reduce pass-by noise. The Swiss Agency for the Environment (BUWAL) commissioned a measurement campaign in the year 2003 to define the noise limit, test conditions and maintenance procedures for retrofitted freight wagons.

The test was set up in order to allow the control, or at least the knowledge of all relevant parameters concerning track, vehicles, test and boundary conditions. A track section was reconstructed. The test train was arranged with one reference group of wagons with cast iron brake blocks and several groups of wagons with composite brake blocks and different characteristics. As all wagon groups were operated together in one test train, boundary conditions and test parameters were identical for all wagons.

The noise reduction achieved relative to cast iron block braked vehicles was in the expected range. Additionally, it could be observed that standard procedures in infrastructure and freight wagon maintenance do not ensure a sustained noise reduction. Several effects destroy this noise reduction. Measures to ensure a qualified noise reduction sustained for the full lifetime of a freight wagon were identified.},

Cooling characteristics of this novel design are practically identical to the disc with tangential vanes but the equivalent aerodynamic (air pumping) losses are approximately 50\% less. It is shown that these reductions in pumping losses can lead to substantial energy savings in train operations.

When developing new designs and/or comparing different railway disc designs, the proposed disc cooling to aerodynamic efficiency ratio (ηv) was found to be a very useful parameter to assess. This ‘efficiency ratio’ – a ratio of convective power dissipation to aerodynamic power losses can help in achieving adequate balance of cooling efficiency and aerodynamic losses to suit particular application. The use of CFD is of enormous benefit in generating discs that fulfil these demanding requirements, with the spin rig being exceptionally useful for experimental work.},

The method was previously used to simulate the form change in a two-roller contact. The progress is made in the terms of general geometry modelling, which makes differences in the various contact configurations. The normal contact problem is analysed using the modified Winkler method and calibrated using the results from FEM modelling of the wheel–rail contact with elastic–plastic material model. A piecewise approach and stick-slip analysis of the rolling–sliding contact solves the tangential problem. A linear wear law is used in the wear computation.

	abstract = {This paper presents results from simulations of railhead wear due to initial sinusoidal and broad-band roughness using a time-domain wheel–track vertical interaction model integrated with a three-dimensional wheel–rail contact model. As typical roughness wavelengths are short and frequencies are high compared with vehicle body motions, the vehicle is simplified to an unsprung wheel mass. The rail is modelled as a Timoshenko beam discretely supported by pads, sleepers and ballast. The wheel–rail contact in the interaction model is modelled with a non-linear Hertzian contact spring. The obtained wheel–rail forces are then incorporated into the three-dimensional contact model to calculate wear over the railhead. The wheel–rail contact is modelled as non-Hertzian and non-steady based on the Variational Method [G. Xie, S.D. Iwnicki, Calculation of wear on a corrugated rail using a three-dimensional contact model, in: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Contact Mechanics and Wear of Rail/Wheel Systems, Brisbane, Australia, Materials Australia, 2006] and the wear is assumed to be proportional to the friction work. Cases of both a free and a driven wheel with a constant torque are considered. The phase angles between dynamic wheel–rail force and roughness are examined and wear is found to be almost in-phase with roughness and therefore, no roughness growth is predicted by the model as presented in its current form. Although clearly in contradiction to reality where roughness grows under certain conditions this work leads to interesting question about why roughness growth is predicted by a simple contact model but not when complexity is increased to include non-Hertzian and non-steady contact conditions.},

	abstract = {Some important papers concerning the studies on rail wear and wheel/rail contact stresses are briefly reviewed. The present paper utilizes a numerical method to analyze the effect of railway vehicle curving on the wear and contact stresses of wheel/rail. The numerical method considers a combination of Kalker's non-Hertzian rolling contact theory, a material wear model and a vertical and lateral coupling dynamics model of the vehicle/track. In the analysis, the important factors influencing on the wear and the contact stresses are, respectively, the curving speed, the curved track super-elevation and the rail cant. Compared to the present model, some concerned models and results in the published papers are in detail discussed. Through the detailed numerical analysis, it is found that the difference between the normal loads of the left and right of the wheelset increases linearly with increasing the vehicle curving speed. The material wear volume per length along the rail running surface has a tendency to grow. However, the variation of the maximum normal contact stress has a large fluctuation as the curving speed increases. The increase of the maximum contact stress depends greatly on not only the normal load but also the profiles of the wheel/rail. Increasing the track super elevation efficiently lowers the normal load difference of the left and right of the front wheelset, and the contact stresses and the wear. The rail cant has a great influence on the low rail wear of the curve track. An increase in rail cant results in a great increase in the low rail wear of the curved track, and a decrease in the outside rail wear. These conclusions are very useful in the maintenance of the track.},

It is a cost-effective process to attain a high degree of required global planarity in the production of integrated circuit components. This paper reports on a fully three-dimensional finite element analysis of the stress and deformation field of a porous compliant polishing pad of finite thickness in contact with a rigid wafer; coupled to a FEM flow analysis of the slurry. The pad deformation is governed by the classical linear elasticity equations. The pad presents a rough porous surface to the wafer. The fluid flow between the pad and wafer is accounted for by the Reynolds equation. The linkage between the solid contact stress and the effective fluid film is through the Greenwood-Williamson model that relates the contact pressure of the pad asperities and the effective surface separation distance.

The pressure predictions of this model fit experimental results reasonably well. Surprisingly, for most conditions, the average fluid pressure at the silicon/pad interface is sub-ambient (suction). The overall fluid unit pressure can be approximately 50–100\% of the applied normal load. The contact normal stress is not symmetric about the wafer center due to the presence of contact friction. Greater contact stress causes a thinner film at the leading edge. Such a net diverging fluid film causes negative fluid pressures.},

The most common cases of rail corrugation that have been documented in the literature were classified by Grassie [1] in six categories, according to the damage and wavelength fixing mechanisms. Except for heavy haul railroads corrugation and for light rail corrugation, in all the other four types of rail corrugation the damage mechanism is wear. This paper analyses the possible existence and degree of rail corrugation wear on four types of high speed tracks (RHEDA 2000, AFTRAV, STEDEF and high performance ballasted track), examining different vehicle velocities and track radii, and taking into account the dynamic behaviour of the high speed wheelset rolling on the rails. A numerical method that takes into account the dynamics of the track and the wheelset as well as the wear mechanism has been used. The four high speed tracks are ranked according to rail corrugation wear development.},

SEM and optical microscopy were used to characterize the microstructure of the materials tested. To evaluate the mechanical properties, the microhardness distribution was determined from the surface to the central region. Wear tests were performed under dry friction conditions with WC balls at a 5-N normal load in a ball-on-disk geometry.

The results of this study indicated that the surface properties of the material could be modified with the TIG method and by using SiC/C particles and that the newly formed structure could improve the wear characteristics and the hardness of the surface.},

The products of SHS were subsequently laser alloyed onto the substrate, whereby, a hard, nanostructured coating was formed comprising of Al2O3, TiB2 and TiN. Excess h-BN in the precursor resulted in the presence of free h-BN in the coating. Microhardness and coefficient of friction (with WC-Co as counterbody) of the coating were found to reduce with increase in h-BN content in the precursor. It was possible to develop a coating with a property combination of high hardness, low wear rate and low friction coefficient.},

	abstract = {Laser surface treatments offer significant potential for improvement of materials properties such as corrosion performance and wear resistance. In large area applications, overlapping of individual tracks corresponding to the width of the laser beam is often required. This involves the heat treatment of a region adjacent to the previous track with microstructural changes such as precipitate coarsening and microsegregation at the overlap regions, which can lead to detrimental effects on the corrosion performance. This paper reports the characteristics and corrosion behaviour of the overlapped areas in the laser melting and alloying with Cr, W, Zr–Ni or Ti–Ni of 2014 aluminium alloy. It is shown that microsegregation occurs within the planar front zone of laser melted samples and microstructural coarsening occurs in the heat affected zones caused by the reheating effect at the laser track overlaps. Electrochemical testing has indicated that microsegregation within the overlapped areas leads to initiation of pitting corrosion in most of these cases.},

However, under the impact of high-speed steam and water droplets, the blades are prone to cavitation, which could lead to lower efficiency, shorter life time, and even accidents. In this article, the 17-4PH blade's surface was alloyed using a high power CO2 laser. The microstructure and microhardness of hardened 17-4PH were tested by scanning electronic microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) and a microhardness tester. After laser alloying, the surface layer was denser and the grain refined, while the microhardness of the surface (average 610HV0.2) was about one times higher than that of the substrate material (330HV0.2). The friction coefficient of the laser-alloyed 17-4PH layer was much lower than that of the substrate.},

A slurry containing WC powder was preplaced on the substrate by pasting and processed with a high-power CW Nd:YAG laser to achieve surface alloying. The composition and microstructure of the alloyed layer and the phases formed were investigated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffractometry, respectively. The cavitation erosion behavior of the laser surface-alloyed samples in 3.5\% NaCl solution was studied with a vibratory cavitation erosion tester. The microhardness of the alloyed layer increases with the total W content in the layer. By employing proper processing parameters, an alloyed layer that is hard but not too brittle can be formed, with a cavitation erosion resistance that may reach more than 30 times that of the as-received 316. The improvement in cavitation erosion resistance may be attributed to the increase of W in solid solution and to the precipitation of dendritic carbides, both resulting from the dissociation of the fine WC powder during laser processing.},
